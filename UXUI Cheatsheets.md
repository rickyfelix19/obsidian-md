1.  Introduction
    
    -   USYD provides one of the best UIUX, but the majority is not able to land intern before grad; context only 1/4 landed grad in 2019 ( before covid )
    -   the applicant's arent talented enough in design - the company but they aren't actually connecting
    -   Most UIUX roles close on either Jan or March; March and April -> Recruitment; June to July, all the grad roles are filled
    -   Check Digital Experience - Deloitte
    -   About USYD
        -   Lack of awareness of industry opportunities
        -   Obsession with portfolios
        -   Students are too self-conscious and perfectionists to the point that it's harmful
            
2.  Myths
    
    -   _Internships and Graduates are for people who have already graduated_
        -   Do apply for 10 to 12 months before it starts
    -   _You need a portfolio to get a UX/UI internship or grad role_
        -   Portfolio are required ( or full time people or people who have experienced ) but most of the digital grads / interns don't need an experience
        -   Portfolio are one of the reason why people dont apply, but most of the case it doenst required it; except for like big companies and digital agencies
