### What is GI Joe Fallacy

> The mistaken idea that "knowing" is half the battle
>
> Merely knowing something is not enough to change your behavior
>
> Vision as a Metaphor

- *Muller-Lyer Ilussion*

  The Muller-Lyer illusion is a well-known optical illusion in which two  lines of the same length appear to be of different lengths. The illusion was first created by a German [psychologist](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-psychologist-2794926) named Franz Carl Muller-Lyer in 1889.![Illustration of the Muller-Lyer Illusion](https://www.verywellmind.com/thmb/AZkF2yqvNeJEWKiuFBnS3nzEb1k=/500x350/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/muller-lyer-illusion-5672bd393df78ccc15f7d08d.jpg)

### Measure your Baseline Happiness

> Your first "assignment" is to measure your current level of happiness using one or two validated psychological surveys. These scores will serve as a “baseline” of your happiness level at the start of this experience. At the end of the course, you’ll redo the survey to see if your happiness and overall mood have changed after doing these positive practices for several weeks. This process will help you understand your journey by giving you a point A and a Point B. In other words, you will be able to understand what your current happiness level is right now, how much room for growth you have, and whether you have changed over time as a result of applying the lessons in this course.  

Your first "assignment" is to measure your current level of happiness using one or two validated psychological surveys. These scores will serve as a “baseline” of your happiness level at the start of this experience. At the end of the course, you’ll redo the survey to see if your happiness and overall mood have changed after doing these positive practices for several weeks

You may choose any option or any combination of options outlined below:

1. **PERMA** (Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment- the basic dimensions of psychological flourishing) -> It's contains 23 questions and you'll receive scores from 0-10 for each pillar along with scores for overall well-being, health, and negative emotions
2. **The Authentic Happiness Inventory** 
   It's a quick set of 24 questions that provides an overall measure of happiness levels. At the end of the survey you will receive a score from 1 to 5 based on your responses
3. If you don't want to do an online survey, another option is **<u>to ask yourself and scale yourself from 1 - 5</u>**

**Regardless of which option you choose, please keep track of your score and write it down somewhere you will remember for later.**

#### Find Your Signature Strengths

- **To identify your strengths, take the free, online, research-based** [**character strengths survey**](https://www.viacharacter.org/account/registercoursera) **by the VIA Institute on Character.** -> The survey comprises 96 questions and takes about 15 minutes to complete. 

  The key is to be authentic, so that you can derive the most from the experience. After taking the survey, you will get the ranking of your 24 strengths. 

  Print it out if you can and keep track of your top 5 strengths. Your top 5 strengths are typically your signature strengths, the characteristics that make you feel energized and engaged.

- Encourage your co-workers, friends, and family to go to the [VIA website](https://www.viacharacter.org/) to take the questionnaire too, so that you can discuss your strengths and how they contribute to your life and relationships. **(USE DATA COLLECTION)**

  Research shows knowing and using your character strengths can strengthen relationships, boost happiness and improve well-being. After taking the test, you will get the ranking of your 24 strengths. 

  **Make sure to document your top 5 strengths.** 

- **ALTERNATIVE:** If you do not feel comfortable sharing your information, you can review the descriptions of the [24 Character Strengths](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths) and self-identify your top strengths.

#### Use Your Signature Strengths

To get you into the practice of doing intentional and effortful activities to boost your own happiness, we want you to try to use your top strengths this week. Each day for the following week, try to use your selected strength in a new way. For example, if curiosity is one of your strengths, enroll in another Coursera course on a topic you know nothing about; if kindness is your strength, perform an anonymous favor for someone; and so on. Try to use your strengths at least once per day all week long. [Learn more here](https://www.viacharacter.org/topics/articles/use-your-strengths-to-boost-happiness)

- Find suggestions on ways to use each strength [here](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths)
- other strengths-based strategies to help you flourish [here](https://www.viacharacter.org/topics/articles/research-backed-strategies-to-help-you-flourish)

## Week 2

### Requirements for this week

#### Savoring & Gratitude

> This week, we’ll rewire our habits by focusing on the good things in life. Specifically, we’ll try to make a habit of practicing gratitude and savoring the good things in our lives.

##### Savoring

Savoring is the act of stepping outside of an experience to review and appreciate it. Often we fail to stay in the moment and really enjoy what we’re experiencing. Savoring intensifies and lengthens the positive emotions that come with doing something you love. It turns out savoring can boost our mood in at least three ways. 

- First, savoring can thwart hedonic adaptation. It can make us remember the good stuff in life.
- Second, savoring can help thwart mind wandering. It keeps us in the moment. 
- And finally, savoring can help us increase gratitude. It can make us thankful for the experiences we're having as we're having them. 

**For the next seven days, you will practice the art of savoring by picking one experience to truly savor each day**. It could be a nice shower, a delicious meal, a great walk outside, or any experience that you really enjoy. When you take part in this savored experience, be sure to practice some common techniques that enhance savoring. These techniques include: 

- sharing the experience with another person, 
- thinking about how lucky you are to enjoy such an amazing moment, 
- keeping a souvenir or photo of that activity, 
- and making sure you stay in the present moment the entire time. 
- Every night, make a note of what you savored 

> (Note: you can make a list in a notebook, use a notes app on your phone, use a calendar, or whatever works for you!). When you do write things down at the end of the day, be sure to take a moment to remember the activity.

##### Daily Gratitude Journal

Gratitude is a positive emotional state in which one recognizes and appreciates what one has received in life. Research shows that taking time to experience gratitude can make you happier and even healthier. 

**For the next seven days, you will take 5-10 minutes each night to write down five things for which you are grateful.** They can be little things or big things. But you really have to focus on them and actually write them down (Again, try to develop a tracking method works for you and utilize a note on your phone, a daily calendar, a special notebook, etc). 

> You can just write a word or short phrase, but as you write these things down, take a moment to be mindful of the things you’re writing about (e.g., imagine the person or thing you’re writing about, etc.). This exercise should take at least five minutes. Do this each night for the whole week.

##### Resources:

- Learn more about the [science of gratitude from expert Robert Emmons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLjVOvZufNM)

  > gratitude has 3 powers: to heal, to energize, to change life
  > can give brightfullness, positiveness. there are good things in life
  > obv there are burdens, problems, but despite all that there are goodness in our life
  >
  > where does this good stuff comes from? who do i give this too:
  > thanks to <someone> recognize where it comes from, for instance our friends, families, God. and grateful for this gift
  >
  > grateful people have advantages in life and more successful; help people -> compassion, forgiving, pro-social

### Things We Think Will Make Us Happy (But Don't)

#### Part 1 - Good job

> What are the thing that you think that will make you happy?
>
> > This might sound very meta, but i want to choose my own happiness compared with others. I want to be happy; share my love and happiness towards everyone

*You are about to learn that everything you thought would make you happy is wrong*

1. what sorts of goals would make us happy

   - **a good job**; does getting a good job make us happier?

     - GILBERT ET AL. (1998) based on the experiments he conducted to uni students:
       (0 - 10 happiness)

       1. <u>what happen if you got rejected</u>
          - predicted drop in happiness -> 2.10 points
          - actual drop in happiness -> 0.68 points

       2. <u>after an unfair decision</u> ( bad interview, etc )
          - predicted drop in happiness -> 1.90 points
          - actual drop in happiness -> 0.00 points
            (*they dk what they are doing tf, lmao*) 

2. what salary is enough to make us happy

   - LinkedIn shows:

     ![image-20210919235306448](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210919235306448.png)

     

   - LYUMBOMIRSKY (2008) -> how much salary do you need?

     - Currently Earning: $30,000
       - If I want to be happy: $50,000
     - Currently Earning $100,000
       - If I want to be happy: $ 250,000

   > The point is that it's not just some objective number that we think. What we think we need actually jumps up every time we get more. And so, this seems to be a problem for kind of finding a good job that's going to give us a good salary. 

#### Part 2 - Money

> When we are talking about a good job, it's really about how much money you can get.
> We know this not just from what people are applying for in terms of their jobs. We know this in terms of how people spend money to try to get money. 

1. Does money really makes us happy? -> What's the correlation between "Life Satisfaction" & Income (Ed Diener)

   - Measuered by income and their life satisfaction (actual coorelation is actually **0.10** 
     which is basically almost not existing)

     ![image-20210920000255325](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920000255325.png)

   - as comparison, here's **0.25 correlation**

     ![image-20210920000513659](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920000513659.png)

   - graph comparison between poor and richer nations:

     ![image-20210920000643270](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920000643270.png)

   - Actual Correlations

     - Income doesnt have that much impact on happiness
     - poorer >> richer nations
     - once you get money for basic needs, extra money wont help you that much

   - Compared between times

     ![image-20210920000822836](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920000822836.png)

     - 1940 when only basic needs are met
     - 2015 when you have a lot of stuffs, ipad, etc

   - David Myers says we are living on a paradox

     > *Compared with their grandparents, today's young adults have grown up with much more affuence, slightly less happiness and much greater risk of depression and ssorted social pathology...*
     >
     > 
     >
     > *Our becoming much better off over the last four decades has not been accompanied by one iota of increased subjective well-being*

   - David Kahneman and Angus Deaton -> An income Threshold for Happiness

     - 450,000 Americans Polled in 2008 - 9

     - Looked at Home Income Predicts:

       - POSITIVE AFFECT (smiling, happiness, daily enjoyment)
       - NOT BLUE (not reporting worry, sad)
       - STRESS-FREE (did no report stress on the previous day)

     - result: 

       ![image-20210920001607570](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920001607570.png)

       - threshold: ***$75,000***
       - EWB (Emotional Well-Being) rises with Low Income, But no progress after income > $75k
       - $75k = "A plausible number at which you think money is not an issue"
       - $75k is enought to get things in America

2. How much does Yale University get

   ![image-20210920001709222](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920001709222.png)

   > Across different Ivy League schools. So, that is median student income at age 34. 
   >
   > Yale is ranked among the Ivy's as the sixth Ivy in terms of what you can make when you get out of here. Not so bad, but the relevant number is the median income, age 34 is over that threshold, $76,000. 
   >
   > So, basically when you guys turn 34, you guys are set. You're not going to have any more income happiness increase, is basically what the statistic is. So most Yalies when they get out of here, after they turn 34 are just set. So, you think $75,000 sounds like a lot, probably most of you in this room will make that. 
   >
   > So, you guys are good. So, that was the Kahneman and Deaton finding. 

3. He then asked how much will more money make people happier

   - Using Life Evaluation

   - By using ladder numbered 0 - 10 from bottom to top

     - graph:

       ![image-20210920002046641](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920002046641.png)

   > we though high income creates more happiness but **it doesnt** but **makes you think it makes you happier** (only a little bit but not tha much)

#### Part 3 - Awesome Stuff, True Love, Perfect Body & Good Grades

#### Awesome Stuff

> By having awesome stuff we can be happier
>
> "If only I had ____ I would be so happy"
> car, good apartment, etc

- in hip hop songs:

  - they mention cars![image-20210920002720742](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920002720742.png)

  - they mention liquir

    ![image-20210920002811275](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920002811275.png)

> scientist found out that by being materialistic, it actually makes us unhappy 

1. NICKERSEN ET AL. (2003)
   - conduct 12,000 freshman in 1976 asked about materialist attitudes
     - 20 years later asked about life satisfaction
     - materialists had lower life satisfaction vs non-materialist two decades later
     - materialists also had more mentla disorders
   - seeking awesome stuff wont make you happy

##### True Love

1. LUCAS ET AL (2003)

   - 25,000 people survived for 15 years

   - 1716 got married

   - are married people happier?

     - married people are happier in 1 - 2 years

     - but after that married = non-married

     - graph:

       ![image-20210920003417477](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920003417477.png)

     - during the first 2 year, it went up but after year 2 it goes back to backline (before marriage)

##### Having a Perfect Body / Mind / Etc

1. JACKSON ET AL. (2014)

   - 1,979 obese individual followed for 4 years after diet program

   - three different groups: weight loss, weight gain, weight same

     - graph:

       ![image-20210920003731388](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920003731388.png)

     - fat people that loses weight in 4 years time actually more depressed double its orginal

     - losing weight wont make us happy especially successfull

2. VON SOEST ET AL (2011)

   - 1,597 Adolescents surveyed over 13 years

   - 5% underwent cosmetic surgery

     - graph:

       ![image-20210920004015168](C:\Users\Felix\Downloads\image-20210920004015168.png)

     - after surgery, it actually got worse even double

3. LEVINE ET AL. (2012)

   - if you get a grade that is lower/ higher than you expect, how happy you will get
   - from 1 - 9
     - graph:
       ![image-20210920004318401](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920004318401.png)
     - high grads wont make as happy as you think

### Why We have Misconceptions

#### Annoying Features of the Mind

*let's take a moment to reflect all this*

does this things make them happier:

- good job
- lots of money
- awesome stuff
- true love
- the perfect body
- the perfect grades

> NO. IT WON;T MAKE YOU HAPPY

##### why don't these things dont make us happy

1. happiness is just set genetically so can't really be changed
   - maybe you are just are half-full glass person or full glass person or empty glass person
2. stuff happens and messes things up
   - in the end of the day it balances things out, bad things happens and good thing will balance it out

> THESE TWO ANSWERS ARE WRONG

Sonja Lyubomirsky, GENES & CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T MATTER AS MUCH AS WE THINK!

> How much do life circumstances play into happiness, and so on. 
>
> And the fast version of it, is that to look at the role of genes, she's been able to look at different happiness measures across identical twins who presumably have the same genes. And she can compare their kind of happiness correlation with happiness correlations across fraternal twins, who don't have the same genes, but have similar life circumstances. 
>
> Bunch of studies on that. 
>
> There's also a bunch of studies looking at life circumstances.Particularly, people's life circumstances where there's been some sort of train wreck, for lack of a better term. Really terrible things happen, you become paraplegic, you lose your job, you become a widow, all these things. 
>
> And you can kind of parse all the different parts together, and ask, how much of a contribution is all these different things actually making? 

- graph:
  ![image-20210920005050995](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210920005050995.png)
- genes are only invovle 50% of our happiness
- actions / thoughts is actually something that we can control over this

> *Our intentional, effortful activities have a powerful effect on how happy we are, over and above the effects of our set points and the circumstances in which we find ourselves*
>
> Sonja Lyubomirsky
>
> > we can work hard to be happier but we choose the wrong thing
> >
> > There are things we can do to become Happier. But most of the goals we think will make us happy don't really make us happy

#### that science stuff might not apply to me

an annoying feature of the mind that's leading you astray:

our minds' strongest intuitions are often totally wrong

- table (refer above)
- arrow (refer above)
- if a baseball and a bat cost $1.10 together,
  and the bat costs 1 dollar more than the ball,
  how much the ball cost? (5 cent; btw lmao)
- **your intuition about happiness is often totally wrong**

> Most of the goals we think will make us happy don't really make us happy

### Review:

#### Questions & Answers

1. What about the most extreme cases? How do we know if we not in that case

   - There's a range but almost everybody is mis-predicting / Affective Forecasting. We are often wrong the thing that effects us like duration or how hard it is going to impact us

2. How much people happiness is dependent on other people / their environment 

   - Our minds are very sensitive to context and nothing is absolute. And this thing include other people. For example, salaries / grade marks

   - if you hangout with people who have X amount of salaries in which, it is higher than you, you will want to reach that as well; 
     Social Comparison matters a lot and affect us a lot, like Snapchat

3. Why is American more materialistic and more happy in the past couple of years? and Why?

   - Social Media and Culture in America; they tend to show-off and economy tend to make American want to spend stuff and show-off. America live in a society that lives on that stuff

4. There are a lot of factors affecting US people mental health such as showing off on social media. On the other hand, there's also a drastic increase in the prescription of antidepressants. Is there a correlation between this issue with the pharmaceutical companies growing and the amounts of drug available. Additionally, people are more open to talk about their mental health and take drugs as a way to cope with it instead of fixing their habit

   - it is good that most people are more open to talk about this kind of stuff and more stuff
   - payoff culture - company want them to use it and convince doctor to sell it; ads and marketing 
   - medicine is going to heal things, there's also a movement in the food domain "food as medicine", don't eat medicine and solve it by eating certain foods

5. While economy is involve a lot with how our society is making decision by telling us to buy more and be better than we are right now and desire something else. How about social factors, there must be a way for us to question the intuitions that create those social ideas and notions on a broader scale? 

   - stop consuming social media
   - support movement in other ways (social justice) contradicting work on a place that doesn't promote this

6. There's a lot of opinions, do this, do that, how do i know and which one should i question

   - one technique is mindfulness and being mindful about this thoughts. most of this are just thoughts, and by taking a step back, you can realize and understand and look at your own data whether this information helps you
   - craving is just a thoughts; the process of mindfulness is asking "what can i get out of this"

7. is it possible that as millennials, there are certain traits that are making us more unhappy compared with previous generation such as our parents or grandparents

   - short answer is mixed.

## Week 3

### Requirement this week

#### Random Act of Kindness

Research shows that happy people are motivated to do kind things for others.
Over the next seven days, you will perform seven acts of kindness beyond what you normally do. You can do one extra act of kindness per day, or a few acts of kindness. At the end of each day, list your random act of kindness. Just make sure you've finished seven total new acts of kindness by the end of the week

> Kindness can increase social connection, make you happy

#### Make A Social Connection

Our social connection matters. Research shows that happy people spend more time with others and have a richer set of social connections than unhappy people. Studies even show that the simple act of talking to a stranger on the street can boost our mood than we expect.
Over the next seven days, you will try to focus on making one new social connection per day. It can be a small 5-minute act like sparking a conversation with someone on public transportation, asking a coworker about his / her cay, or chatting to barista at coffee shop. But also do seek out meaningful social connections, too. At least once a week, to someone you care about like you friend away or family member.

> Social Connection can make us happy :))

### Annoying Features of the Mind

Why are our expectations are so bad

#### Feature #1 - Our minds strongest intuitions are totally often wrong

> According to Tim Wilson and Dan Gilbert, mistwanting is the act of being mistaken about what and how much you will like something in the future. 

For example the picture below that was discussed on the previous week

#### Feature #2 - Our minds don't think in terms of absolutes

> We often think in a very relative terms or reference point.
>
> A reference point is a Salient (but often irrelevant) standard against which all subsequent information is compared

  Whatever your counterfactual is, it's affecting your happiness. It's not your absolute level or the absolute medal you got, it's what you think you could have gotten, right?

We think everything as reference point, like having high payment career

  > What's a Reasonable Social Comparison?

  For example, a good and logical reference point to compare income is between the professor and his colleague that is also doing an online course in Coursera. It will be crazy to compare her salary with Beyonce

Everything is about reference point,

- lifestyle,
- people,
- good grades

> tl;dr: social comparison to good job, awesome stuff, true love, the perfect body, the perfect grades is going to make us sad

Millennials have the special reference point such as social media. For example on Facebook
