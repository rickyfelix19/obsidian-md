## Week 1

Introductory Readings:
1. [History of Psychology](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology)
	*The articles examine the development of psychology in America and use the mid-19th century as our starting point. For the sake of convenience, we refer to this as a history of modern psychology.* Expand to check timeline
	   ![[Timeline.png]]
	1. **Physiology and Psychophysics**
		1. An important implication of German physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) work was that there is a psychological reality and a physical reality and that the two are not identical.
		2. The question of the relationship between the mental (experiences of the senses) and the material (external reality) was investigated by a number of German researchers including Ernst Weber and Gustav Fechner. Their work was called [psychophysics](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#vocabulary-psychophysics), and it introduced methods for measuring the relationship between physical stimuli and human perception that would serve as the basis for the new science of psychology ([Fancher & Rutherford, 2011](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#reference-8)).
		3. The formal development of modern psychology is usually credited to the work of German physician, physiologist, and philosopher Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920).  Wundt attracted students from around the world to study the new experimental psychology and work in his lab. Students were trained to offer detailed self-reports of their reactions to various stimuli, a procedure known as [introspection](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#vocabulary-introspection). The goal was to identify the elements of [consciousness](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#vocabulary-consciousness). In addition to the study of sensation and perception, research was done on mental chronometry, more commonly known as reaction time.
	2. **Scientific Psychology Comes to the United States**
		1. Wundt’s version of psychology arrived in America most visibly through the work of Edward Bradford Titchener (1867–1927). A student of Wundt’s, Titchener brought to America a brand of experimental psychology referred to as “[structuralism](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#vocabulary-structuralism).” Structuralists were interested in the contents of the mind—what the mind is. For Titchener, the general adult mind was the proper focus for the new psychology, and he excluded from study those with mental deficiencies, children, and animals ([Evans, 1972](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#reference-5); [Titchener, 1909](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#reference-21)).
	3. **Toward a Functional Psychology**
		1. While Titchener and his followers adhered to a structural psychology, others in America were pursuing different approaches. William James, G. Stanley Hall, and James McKeen Cattell were among a group that became identified with “[functionalism](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#vocabulary-functionalism).” Influenced by Darwin’s evolutionary theory, functionalists were interested in the activities of the mind—what the mind does. An interest in functionalism opened the way for the study of a wide range of approaches, including animal and comparative psychology ([Benjamin, 2007](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#reference-23))
		2. William James (1842–1910) is regarded as writing perhaps the most influential and important book in the field of psychology, _Principles of Psychology_
		3. G. Stanley Hall (1844–1924) made substantial and lasting contributions to the establishment of psychology in the United States. At Johns Hopkins University, he founded the first psychological laboratory in America in 1883. In 1887, he created the first journal of psychology in America, _American Journal of Psychology_. In 1892, he founded the American Psychological Association (APA); in 1909, he invited and hosted Freud at Clark University (the only time Freud visited America). Influenced by evolutionary theory, Hall was interested in the process of adaptation and human development
		4. James McKeen Cattell (1860–1944) received his Ph.D. with Wundt but quickly turned his interests to the assessment of [individual differences](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#vocabulary-individual-differences). Influenced by the work of Darwin’s cousin, Frances Galton, Cattell believed that mental abilities such as intelligence were inherited and could be measured using mental tests.
	4. **The Growth of Psychology**
		1. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, psychology continued to grow and flourish in America. It was large enough to accommodate varying points of view on the nature of mind and behavior. [Gestalt psychology](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#vocabulary-gestalt-psychology) -- The saying “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” is a Gestalt perspective. In many ways, the work of the Gestalt psychologists served as a precursor to the rise of [cognitive psychology](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#vocabulary-cognitive-psychology) in America ([Benjamin, 2007](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#reference-23)).
		2. [Behaviorism](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#vocabulary-behaviorism) emerged early in the 20th century and became a major force in American psychology. Behaviorism rejected any reference to mind and viewed overt and observable behavior as the proper subject matter of psychology. Through the scientific study of behavior, it was hoped that laws of learning could be derived that would promote the prediction and control of behavior.
		3. For decades, behaviorism dominated American psychology. By the 1960s, psychologists began to recognize that behaviorism was unable to fully explain human behavior because it neglected mental processes.
	5. **Applied Psychology in America**
		1. In America, there has always been an interest in the application of psychology to everyday life. Mental testing is an important example.
		2. Applied psychology was not limited to mental testing. What psychologists were learning in their laboratories was applied in many settings including the military, business, industry, and education.
		3. Clinical psychology was also an early application of experimental psychology in America.
	6. **Psychology as a Profession**
		1. As the roles of psychologists and the needs of the public continued to change, it was necessary for psychology to begin to define itself as a profession. Without standards for training and practice, anyone could use the title psychologist and offer services to the public. As early as 1917, applied psychologists organized to create standards for education, training, and licensure. By the 1930s, these efforts led to the creation of the American Association for Applied Psychology (AAAP). While the American Psychological Association (APA) represented the interests of academic psychologists, AAAP served those in education, industry, consulting, and clinical work.
		2. The advent of WWII changed everything--there were simply not enough mental health professionals to meet the need. APA and AAAP combined, held a meeting and a new model of training is born.
	7. **Psychology and Society**
		1. For more than a century, psychology and psychologists have been agents of social action and change. Using the methods and tools of science, psychologists have challenged assumptions, stereotypes, and stigma. i.e:
			1. Working in the early 20th century, when women’s rights were marginalized, Thompson examined the assumption that women were overemotional compared to men and found that emotion did not influence women’s decisions any more than it did men’s. Hollingworth found that menstruation did not negatively impact women’s cognitive or motor abilities.
		2. Among the first generation of African American psychologists, Mamie Phipps Clark (1917–1983) and her husband Kenneth Clark (1914–2005) studied the psychology of race and demonstrated the ways in which school segregation negatively impacted the self-esteem of African American children. Their research was influential in the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in the case of _Brown v. Board of Education,_ which ended school segregation ([Guthrie, 2003](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#reference-25)).
	8. **Conclusion**
		 - *Growth and expansion have been a constant in American psychology. In the latter part of the 20th century, areas such as social, developmental, and personality psychology made major contributions to our understanding of what it means to be human. Today neuroscience is enjoying tremendous interest and growth.*

2. [Research Designs](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs)
	This articles examine test research questions using a variety of methods. Most research relies on either correlations or experiments.
	1.  With correlations, researchers measure variables as they naturally occur in people and compute the degree to which two variables go together. Experiments allow researchers to make causal inferences.
	2. With experiments, researchers actively make changes in one variable and watch for changes in another variable.
	3. Other types of methods include longitudinal and quasi-experimental designs.
	Many factors, including practical constraints, determine the type of methods researchers use. Often researchers survey people even though it would be better, but more expensive and time consuming, to track them longitudinally.
	
	1. **Types of Research:**
		1. **Research Designs**
			1. In the early 1970’s, a man named Uri Geller tricked the world: he convinced hundreds of thousands of people that he could bend spoons and slow watches using only the power of his mind. In fact, if you were in the audience, you would have likely believed he had psychic powers.
			2. One of the important steps in scientific inquiry is to test our research questions, otherwise known as hypotheses. However, there are many ways to test hypotheses in psychological research.
		2. **Experimental Research**
			1. Psychologists measure many abstract concepts, such as happiness and intelligence, by beginning with [operational definitions](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#vocabulary-operational-definitions) of the concepts.
			2. In an experiment, researchers manipulate, or cause changes, in the [independent variable](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#vocabulary-independent-variable), and observe or measure any impact of those changes in the [dependent variable](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#vocabulary-dependent-variable). 
				1. The independent variable is the one under the experimenter’s control, or the variable that is intentionally altered between groups. In the case of Dunn’s experiment, the independent variable was whether participants spent the money on themselves or on others.
				2. The dependent variable is the variable that is not manipulated at all, or the one where the effect happens. In our example, the participants’ happiness (the dependent variable in this experiment) depends on how the participants spend their money (the independent variable).
				3. What Dunn and her colleagues found was that, after all the spending had been done, the people who had spent the money on others were happier than those who had spent the money on themselves.
			4. The most important thing about experiments is [random assignment](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#vocabulary-random-assignment). Participants don’t get to pick which condition they are in. But another equally important reason is that random assignment makes it so the groups, on average, are similar on all characteristics except what the experimenter manipulates.
		3. **Other Consideration**
			1. In addition to using random assignment, you should avoid introducing confounds into your experiments. [Confounds](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#vocabulary-confounds) are things that could undermine your ability to draw causal inferences.
			2. For example, if you wanted to test if a new happy pill will make people happier, you could randomly assign participants to take the happy pill or not (the independent variable) and compare these two groups on their self-reported happiness (the dependent variable). However, if some participants know they are getting the happy pill, they might develop expectations that influence their self-reported happiness. This is sometimes known as a [placebo effect](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#vocabulary-placebo-effect).
			3. A related idea is [participant demand](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#vocabulary-participant-demand). This occurs when participants try to behave in a way they think the experimenter wants them to behave. Placebo effects and participant demand often occur unintentionally. Even [experimenter expectations](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#vocabulary-experimenter-expectations) can influence the outcome of a study.
			4. One way to prevent these confounds from affecting the results of a study is to use a double-blind procedure. In a double-blind procedure, neither the participant nor the experimenter knows which condition the participant is in.
		4. **Correlational Design**
			1. When scientists passively observe and measure phenomena it is called correlational research. Here, we do not intervene and change behavior, as we do in experiments. In correlational research, we identify patterns of relationships, but we usually cannot infer what causes what. Importantly, with correlational research, you can examine only two variables at a time, no more and no less.
			2. To find out how well two variables correspond, we can plot the relation between the two scores on what is known as a scatterplot.
			3. The association between two variables can be summarized statistically using the correlation coefficient (abbreviated as _r_). A [correlation](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#vocabulary-correlation) coefficient provides information about the direction and strength of the association between two variables.
			4. If generosity and happiness are positively correlated, should we conclude that being generous causes happiness? From a correlation alone, we can’t be certain. For example, in the first case it may be that happiness causes generosity, or that generosity causes happiness. Or, a third variable might cause both happiness _and_ generosity, creating the illusion of a direct link between the two. This is why correlation does not mean causation—an often repeated phrase among psychologists.
		5. **Qualitative Design**
			1. Although something as simple as “observation” may seem like it would be a part of all research methods, participant observation is a distinct methodology that involves the researcher embedding him- or herself into a group in order to study its dynamics.
			2. For example, Festinger, Riecken, and Shacter ([1956](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs#reference-6)) were very interested in the psychology of a particular cult. However, this cult was very secretive and wouldn’t grant interviews to outside members. So, in order to study these people, Festinger and his colleagues pretended to be cult members, allowing them access to the behavior and psychology of the cult. Despite this example, it should be noted that the people being observed in a participant observation study usually know that the researcher is there to study them.
			3. Another qualitative method for research is the case study, which involves an intensive examination of specific individuals or specific contexts. Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, was famous for using this type of methodology; however, more current examples of case studies usually involve brain injuries.
			4. The final qualitative method to be discussed in this section is narrative analysis. Narrative analysis centers around the study of stories and personal accounts of people, groups, or cultures. In this methodology, rather than engaging with participants directly, or quantifying their responses or behaviors, researchers will analyze the themes, structure, and dialogue of each person’s narrative.
		6. **Quasi-Experimental Designs**
			1. A quasi-experimental design is similar to experimental research, except that random assignment to conditions is not used. Instead, we rely on existing group memberships (e.g., married vs. single). As a result, with quasi-experimental designs causal inference is more difficult.
		7. **Longitudinal Studies**
			1. Longitudinal studies track the same people over time. Some longitudinal studies last a few weeks, some a few months, some a year or more. Some studies that have contributed a lot to psychology followed the same people over decades.
		8. **Surveys**
			1. A survey is a way of gathering information, using old-fashioned questionnaires or the Internet. Although surveys are typically used for correlational research, this is not always the case. An experiment can be carried out using surveys as well. 
	2. **Tradeoffs in Research**
		1. In addition to selecting a method that is appropriate to the question, many practical concerns may influence the decision to use one method over another. One of these factors is simply resource availability—how much time and money do you have to invest in the research? (Tip: If you’re doing a senior honor’s thesis, do not embark on a lengthy longitudinal study unless you are prepared to delay graduation!) Often, we survey people even though it would be more precise—but much more difficult—to track them longitudinally. Especially in the case of exploratory research, it may make sense to opt for a cheaper and faster method first. Then, if results from the initial study are promising, the researcher can follow up with a more intensive method.
	3. **Research Methods**
			In order to be a savvy consumer of research, you need to understand the pros and cons of different methods and the distinctions among them. Plus, understanding how psychologists systematically go about answering research questions will help you to solve problems in other domains, both personal and professional, not just in psychology.
	4. **Vocabulary**
		1. **Confounds** -> Factors that undermine the ability to draw causal inferences from an experiment.
		2. **Correlation** -> Measures the association between two variables, or how they go together.
		3. **Dependent variable** -> The variable the researcher measures but does not manipulate in an experiment.
		4. **Experimenter expectations** -> When the experimenter’s expectations influence the outcome of a study.
		5. **Independent variable** -> The variable the researcher manipulates and controls in an experiment.
		6. **Longitudinal study** -> A study that follows the same group of individuals over time.
		7. **Operational definitions** -> How researchers specifically measure a concept.
		8. **Participant demand** -> When participants behave in a way that they think the experimenter wants them to behave.
		9. **Placebo effect** -> When receiving special treatment or something new affects human behavior.
		10. **Quasi-experimental design** -> An experiment that does not require random assignment to conditions.
		11. **Random assignment** -> Assigning participants to receive different conditions of an experiment by chance.

### The astonishing hypothesis

Phineas Gage would try to destroy a rock (with various techniques) and one day it stopped working. One day, a steel (from the rock explosive) went straight to his skull and miraculously he did not die and after various of surgery he survived and is very lucky indeed to have survived without any damage on his brain or any of his motoric-sensors attributes.

Another perspective mentioned he was unlucky because his personality changes, it's like Gage is not Gage anymore. He does not work hard anymore and etc...

> the Astonishing Hypothesis is that You, your joys and your sorrows,
> your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will,
> are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and
> their associated molecules.
> *- Francis Crick, the Nobel prize winning biologist* 

The official term for this is materialism that **we are material beings.** 
...But the idea is that our mental life, what makes us special, our most intimate feelings and thoughts also arise from these material things. And this the idea that makes possible the discipline of neuroscience and much of psychology.

### Dualism

>I knew that I was a substance the whole essence or nature of which is to think, and that for its existence there is no need of any place, nor does it dependent in a material thing.. that is to say, the soul by which I am what I am, is entirely distinct from body.

Rene Descrates believe animal are animal things. But humans are different as we composed of two different things
1. We are in part material 
2. We are in part spiritual: psychological, mental

(Context: Rene was in the late15th - mid16th )
Argument 1: The creativity and spontaneity of human action
is different from animals, robots, and etc. 

Argument 2: Method of doubt ("I think therefore I am")
You could be wrong that that you have a body or there's a physical world (like the Matrix movie)

The idea of your body can be taken over, that your mind and body are different, intelligent beings without bodies. The survival of the self after the destruction of the body (go to heaven, go to hell, limbo, a spirit world, occupying other body/ reincarnation, etc... )

Modern psychologist and scientist sees Dualism as wrong idea to look at things:
- Dualism does not answer important questions: Languages, Memory
- We now have better understanding of what physical things can do (unlike now because we are more advanced compared back in the 16th)
- Strong evidence for the role of the brain including mental health, consciousness, and memory. And current age shows that physical activity that happened does affect us

### Neurons

- i skipped
- talked about drugs can change Neurons behaviour + or -

### Parts of the Brain

- Subcortical Structures
	- controls medulla: autonomic skilled motor movements, mental and sensory tasks, automation of tasks
	- hypothalamus: hunger thrist, sleep, desire
	- cerebral cortex is the outer part of the brain
		- the part where reasoning, language, and perception comes fro
	- Could be sensory problem, etc...
