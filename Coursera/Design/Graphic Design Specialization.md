>This course, as well as the other courses in the [Graphic Design Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/graphic-design), are meant to be general introductions to the topic and are suitable for students with little to no experience in design. Knowing how to create and deliver strong, compelling visual messages is beneficial for a person working in any field, from education to business to technology. Students with more design experience may also get a lot out of these coursesâ€”there are plenty of additional assignments and resources to supplement your existing knowledge.

## 1) Fundamentals of Graphic Design

Fundamentals of Graphic Design, as well as the other courses in the [Graphic Design Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/graphic-design), focus on the key concepts of making strong, informed design work regardless of what software you use. While you may need to use software to complete some assignments, these courses are not focused on teaching you how to use those tools. More information on software requirements are outlined in each course.

## Introduction to Image Making

-   **Denotative Imagemaking**
    A **denotative image** is a rendering of something much as it looks in real life. Even if it's not drawn in a completely realistic way, people will easily understand what it is. Denotative images are straightforward images of a familiar object or thing. They're one of the simplest kinds of image making used in graphic design, and they don't have any deeper or hidden meanings.
    
-   **Connotative Imagemaking**
    A connotative image is **one that has layers of meaning, beyond its face value**. For example, an advertiser for a life insurance company might use an image of a child playing with a toy to convey ideas of family life, safety, and security, or perhaps childhood and nostalgia.

## Imagemaking Methods

1.  Process, Generation, Iteration
	- **Process** driven image making really lets you experiment along the way, quite often without an idea of what the final outcome is gonna be
	- **Generation** is just making as many objects as you can, just trying to continually make and to learn from that making as a continual process. So don't get put off if you get stuck or if you're having a hard time with anything. Just move on and try a different technique or a different way of working.
	- **Iteration** is just that you make a lot of variations of the same thing. You don't just make one image and be done. You actually redraw the same image, try and remake it, rework it, make slightly different versions of it. And what this is allowing you to do is to really test drive your images. So that you make them and you look at them and you can assess which ones are working and which ones aren't.
