### The basics of User Experience Design

- UX is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product
- Product is A good, service, or feature
  Product can be separated into 2 types:
  - Physical Product like Controller, Potato Chips
  - Technology Product like Web, Smartwatch

For a user to have a good experience, a product have to be:

1. Usable
   making it easier to use; design is clear for everyone
2. Equitable
   UX designers need to think about all users, including those with usability, diff backgrounds, etc  
3. Enjoyable
   By researching and doing interview
4. Useful
   Solve problems

>  In 2018, McKenzie reports shows that product that focus on good UX product, this will do better than those who don't

### Jobs in the field of User Experience

UX Designers are curious about people, focuses on making good product, empathetic. Empathetic means UX designers need to think about a user might feel about the product (view and feel)

#### Types of UX Designers

### User Experience Careers

| User Experience Careers     | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. **Interaction Designer** | Interaction designers focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. They strive to understand the user flow, or the path, that a typical user takes to complete a task on an app, website, or  other platform. |
| 2. **Visual Designer**      | Visual designers focus on how a product or technology looks. They are  often responsible for designing logos, illustrations, and icons, as well as deciding on font color, size, and placement. Visual designers focus  on the layout of each page or screen and make all of the design elements fit together in a visually appealing way. |
| 3. **Motion Designer**      | Motion designers think about what it feels like for a user to move  through a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on  an app or website. They may also create animations or visual effects to  bring their design ideas to life. |
| 4. VR / AR Designer         | Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) designers create  products that provide users with immersive experiences, unbounded by the limits of the physical world. **Virtual reality** involves a wearable headset that takes over a user’s vision; it blocks out their physical surroundings and immerses them in a completely virtual world. <br /><br />On the other hand, **augmented reality** uses the physical  world as a backdrop and adds virtual elements on top of it. Users are  still contextually aware of their surroundings, but their reality is  augmented, or enhanced, by adding elements through a screen. For  example, you can sit in your actual kitchen, and an AR experience can  add digital images, like a new barstool or a piece of artwork, to the  room around you. |
| 5. UX Researcher            | UX researchers conduct studies or interviews that examine how people use a product. UX researchers often identify pain points that users are  experiencing and explore how products can help solve those problems.  They also explore the usability of existing products, by asking users to complete tasks in an app or website, |
| 6. UX Writer                | UX writers think about how to make the language within a product clearer so that the user experience is more intuitive. UX writers also help  define a brand’s voice and personality. The work of UX writers often  includes writing labels for buttons and determining the tone of language used within an app or website. |
| 7. UX Program Manager       | UX program managers ensure clear and timely communication, so that the  process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to  finish. This might include setting goals, writing project plans, and  allocating team resources. |
| 8. UX Engineer              | UX engineers translate the design’s intent into a functioning  experience, like an app or a website. They help UX teams figure out if  designs are intuitive and technically feasible. |
| 9. Conversation Designer    | Conversational interfaces are everywhere, from intelligent virtual  assistants like Google Assistant and Siri, to interactive voice response systems like customer service systems you can talk to. Conversational  interfaces even include automobile navigation systems and chatbots!  Conversation design incorporates natural, real-world conversational  behaviors into the interactions between users and these systems. |

### The product development life cycle

![graphic showing the product development lifecycle (represented by a circle)](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/7r-T1J09Sy6_k9SdPbsuXA_98483f0b053e4b7696bd9f02c59b3fdd_Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-2.05.20-PM.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=GVOex7UAvcu6qHwex3Pq5PbxaH9ZFe-b9Dml7eC9Udk)

*Depending on where you work, the exact names of each state might be a little different, but the overall process is generally the same.* 

Every new product, whether an app / physical object, follows a specific set of steps from its first spark of an idea to the release of the final product. 

This is called the **Product Development Life Cycle**

#### 1. Brainstorm

![Subheading - Brainstorm](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/b6LLv7piROOiy7-6YsTj2w_0966b00821154afc92c4f3ec75158f45_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R1_B.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=MwOV0GjUdJciTziQNdX6A9RxtztOfmHQ-nlcyeL41mk)

This is the first stage of Product Development Life Cycle when the team starts thinking of an idea of an product.  Your team either: 

- already know some of the user problems you want to solve before you begin the cycle
- **if not**, making a list of user problems is a great place to start
- Note: a UX designer in a large company are usually not involved in the brainstorm stage. But a startup / small business have a big role to play

It is important to pay attention to the diversity of your team at this stage.
Teams that have meaningful diversity across identifiers like race, gender, abilities, family structure, age, and ethnicity are generally more effective at brainstorming because they bring together a lot of different lived experiences

The brainstorm stage is also an ideal time to check out your product's  competitors and identify if there are already similar products available in the market. You want your product to fill a gap in the market or  solve a problem better than existing products. 

#### 2. Define

![Subheading - Define](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/JW9qDQaTRXavag0Gk3V2fw_893f78fc26cd459089ee13c66073661f_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R1_C.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=IsGEDimto7MtylEUpjiKBI6wxZUMDCbXp1ya18F5JF0)

This is the second stage of product development life cycle. At this stage, it brings together UX designers, UX researchers, program managers, and product leads to define the product. The goal is to figure out the specifications for the product by answering questions like:

- Who is the product for?
- What will the product do?
- And, what features need to be included for the product to be successful?

During this stage, your team narrows down the idea. One product can't solve every user problem. UX Designer might help the team pin down the focus of the idea, but a product lead will probably be the one to define the scope of the project.

Research is the key during the define stage, too. You need to:

> pinpoint users' problems and 
> your team can't assume they know what problems users are experiencing 
> without asking users directly 

User research helps determine what problems need to be addressed by the product's design

#### 3. Design

![Subheading - Design](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_bCk6KP5TW-wpOij-S1vqw_1d4a77fa8cac441eae103bdb019c62c5_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R1_D.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=JY9-cKt-gfMD4FOT5mxrZ3hwtw8UJGTfkaiZ1TgYFTU)

This is the third stage of Product Development Life Cycle. This is when UX Designers, really get to shine! At this stage, UX Designers develop the ideas for the product. Generally, by making:

1. wireframes,
2. creating prototypes,

UX writers are also involve in the design stage and might do things like:

1. write button labels,
2. other copy within the product's wireframes and prototypes

At this point in the life cycle, UX designers make sure to include all the product specification that were outlined in the ***Define Stage***. 

- You might also need to ensure that each part of the design fits together in an intuitive way. For example: the flow of the app or an interaction creates the appropriate action
- With a physical product, UX designers might check that one piece of a physical object matches up to the connecting piece.
- UX designers also make sure that each task a user needs to complete is clear and easy to understand. 

#### 4. Test

![Subheading - Test](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/WSGPH4cXQXKhjx-HF3Fyig_031f790d43bd47d18f6666ae45ba0794_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R1_E.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=6hABicY2YNAYc_c9W5_6xomUS98CW4cN4NVbgPO7Zw0)

This is the fourth stage of the Life Development Cycle. This is when UX designers work with engineers to develop functional prototypes that match the original designs, including details and features that fit the company's brand, like font and color choices. 

This also means writing the code and finalizing the overall structure of the product.

> Alternatively, you can test your design earlier, another option is to test a functioning prototype of the product, using a design tool like Figma / Adobe XD.

At this stage,  the designs go through at least three phases of testing:

1. Internal testes within your company,
2. Reviews with stakeholders*,
3. External tests with potential users

Running these tests is typically the responsibility of the UX researcher on your team, if you have one

1. Team do a **Product Internal Test** (Alpha Testing) to look for technical glitches and usability problems
2. Product undergoes **Test with Stakeholders** to make sure the product is aligned with the company's vision, meets legal guidelines for accessibility. For example: Follows government regulations for privacy
3. **External tests with Potential Users** (Beta Testing) This is the time to figure out whether the product provides a good user experience meaning it's
   - *<u>usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful</u>*

> Gathering and implementing feedback at this stage is absolutely critical. 
>
> If users are frustrated or confused by your product. 
> UX designers make adjustments or even create new versions of the design. Then the designs are tested again, until there's little or no friction between the product and the user

*Stakeholders* is a person you need to work with to complete the project or anyone who has some interest in the project, either within or outside of the company

#### 5. Launch 

![Subheading - Launch](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/YVXYd0K-SOiV2HdCvnjoRQ_35ab9da5a06c4177b264637d8419eee5_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R1_F.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=3BO9fjUTME-Ha4ikkOuNtmmW-giPaf_oLtByniM7CGg)

This is the fifth and the final stage of the product development cycle. This might involve 

- listing an app in the Google Play's Store or Apple's App Store,
- making a website go live,
- putting a physical product on store shelves

The launch stage is a time to celebrate your work and start promoting the product. 

- Marketing professionals on your time might post about the new product on social media / publish a press release. 
- The customer support team might get ready to help new users learn how the product works
- Program managers also meet with the cross-functional team to reflect on the entire product development life cycle. Making a reflection is important, since it can help improve the process going forward.
  Ask questions like
  - what worked and what could be improved
  - were goals achieved
  - were timelines met

>  For a physical product, the launch stage might be the end of the product development life cycle.
>
> But for a digital product (app / website), lunching the product to a wider audience provides another opportunity to improve over UX. New users might find problem with the product's functionality or features to improve that no one noticed before. 

So after the launch stage, teams will often cycle back to the design and testing stages to start working on the next version of the digital product

### Design for a good User Experience

“The basics of user experience design”, you were introduced to some primary characteristics of good UX. These characteristics—**usable**, **equitable**, **enjoyable**, and **useful**—can help you evaluate a product’s design.

### Characteristics for a Good User Experience

#### Usable

![img](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/-geVNuUUSumHlTblFOrpOQ_7a0ba72f2c634664b0ba7959e5f97ff1_Screenshot-2021-06-21-8.56.56-AM.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=JhlEFDd9PROZ4CC3jthmPHTRJ4LtNtgHLkoMB0ldrgg)

If a product is **usable**, it means the design, the structure, and purpose of the product is clear and easy to use. 

#### Equitable

![img](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GhTYoFVdRwuU2KBVXccLhA_200bcd235c4b40c89a462c200873bff1_Screenshot-2021-06-21-8.58.07-AM.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=aQZjXlS8Xdeot9SKEq6tDJ8GfHSil4NCdNS3FfjAoBw)

If a product is **equitable**, it means a design is helpful with diverse abilities and backgrounds. In other words, the product's design addresses the needs of a diverse audience and ensures a high-quality experience is delivered to all users regardless of background, gender, race, or ability

Equity goes beyond the concept of equality, where everyone is given  equal resources, because people often need different tools and support  based on their needs. This is especially important to keep in mind for  those in commonly disenfranchised groups

#### Enjoyable

![img](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/X_yuTaK_TcO8rk2iv83Dhw_09116c52367f4ac59f28d2afe84181f1_Screenshot-2021-06-21-8.57.51-AM.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=wzRhNWdqoLxL6YPw3LVWVavIUxbLrcsOTVtt5WWBnCU)

If a product is **enjoyable**, it means the design delights the user. The design reflects what the user may be thinking or feeling  and creates a positive connection with them. A product’s design doesn’t  have to be enjoyable for it to function properly. But, an enjoyable design adds to an already functional product and can enhance the user’s feelings about the experience.

#### Useful

![img](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/a7t6NgVMRdG7ejYFTLXRCA_51ceae28e7ea4066afdee6322d896df1_Screenshot-2021-06-21-8.57.11-AM.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=rlTGQ8ENKlgAOeJFmtENbOEgseNqciXblz4GVnk1qyM)

If a product is **useful**, that means it solves user  problems. In other words, the design intentionally solves a user problem that the designer has identified. It’s important to note that, while  similar, useful and usable have different meanings. A product that is  useful isn’t always usable. The same is true for the opposite. The  distinction between the two is that usability refers to the product  working well and being easy to use, while usefulness refers directly to  the ability to solve user problems.

### Job responsibilities of entry-level UX Designers

 #### 1. Researching

Understanding audiences and learn about their backgrounds, demographics, motivations, pain points, emotions, and life goals

#### 2. Wireframing

An outline or a sketch of a product or a screen
![image-20210625223914234](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210625223914234.png)

#### 3. Prototyping

An early model of a product that demonstrates functionality

![image-20210625224012010](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210625224012010.png)

#### 4. Creating information architecture

The framework of a website or how it's organized, categorized, and structured

#### 5. Communicating effectively

### A day in life of an entry-level UX Designer

> You'll start by identifying the problems. What are the issues going on within this product? And why are we even looking to improve or introduce this feature?
>
> Once you found the problem, you'll start realize what the solution is and why it needs to be done in a certain why. You then are going to be interacting with everybody on your team. 
>
> This is an opportunity to get the feedback that you really need to be able to push your project to success. Then you'll know how to achieve success.
>
> When you become a UX Designer, you'll receive a lot of critique, this is so that user's have the best solution, then you chat to your seniors to check if this is the best possible solution.

### Specialists, Generalists, and T-shaped designers

#### 1. Generalists

A UX Designer with a broad number of responsibilities. 
As a Generalists, usually you hop around tasks and see which one you like best.
This role is mostly found in small companies / startup

As a Generalists, you are responsible for: 
(most generalist usually only know how to do 2 of these things but then you'll learn on your job)

- User research
- Branding
- User flows
- UX writing
- Visual design
- Prototyping
- Production design
- Information architecture
- Usability testing
- and among other things...

#### 2. Specialists

Dives deep into one particular UX design role, like interaction, visual, or motion design. While Generalists have broad of knowledge, Specialists have an in depth knowledge of one area. Specialists are often found in a bigger companies

#### 3. T-shaped designer

Specializes in one kind of UX design and has a breadth of knowledge in other areas. This does not always happen consciously. 

>  The more experience you get in the industry, the broader your perspective. You'll be exposed to a lot of different companies, design principles, and work styles, and you'll learn how each one can better inform your designs. 

#### Generalists or Special Designer

A visual designer is someone who uses iconography, typography, color, space, and textures in their products to create consistent and accessible design patterns

> As a generalist designer, you work on a bunch of different things from interaction design and visual design to user research.
>
> Your responsible vary from day to day. Most of the time you learn by doing and dont have enough time to learn something in depth.
>
> The benefits of being a specialist are that expectations are very clear for what your role is and there a ton of resources that you can continue to develop your expertise

### The role of a beginner UX Designer

#### Responsibilities of an entry-level UX Designer

![graphic of a person using a laptop, with various icons surrounding them indicating UX design skills](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/SCShS7s9ReSkoUu7PdXkcA_28dbd9eaed4a4cb2a272a61bf0a98c68_Screenshot-2021-03-02-at-11.08.29-PM.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=m8_c17AtDWnhmDcBJAWykfFT_NZFwpyz3icmuarLy30)

1. **User research**: User research is about understanding the people who use your product. Through research, you’ll learn about users’ backgrounds, demographics, motivations, pain points, emotions, and goals. Your research methods might include surveys, observations, and interviews. We’ll explore user research in much more detail in an upcoming course. 
2. **Information architecture:** Information architecture, or IA for short, involves deciding how your product is organized and structured. Think of IA as a skeleton that outlines how users interact with your product. Everything in your product should be organized in ways that make sense to the user and meets their expectations.
3. **Wireframing**: A wireframe is a basic outline or sketch of a product or a screen, like an app or website. As the name suggests, wireframes look like they were created with wires. They’re mostly lines and shapes, with some text. Wireframes can be drawn by hand or created digitally using software. Wireframing helps you bring your design ideas to life, so other people on your team can provide input and feedback.
4. **Prototyping**: A prototype is an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality. Prototypes can be in physical or digital formats and can vary in complexity. Sometimes a prototype is made to demonstrate one specific feature of a product, like the transition between screens or the way the product physically looks and feels. You’ll make multiple prototypes for any given product throughout the design process.
5. **Visual design:** Visual design focuses on how the product or technology looks. As a UX designer, you need to understand the foundations of visual design in order to communicate the connection between a product’s functionality and its appearance to users. You’ll learn some of the most important principles of visual design throughout this certificate program. 
6. **Effective communication**: Effective communication as a UX designer means connecting with your colleagues through emails, meetings, presentations, and design software. UX design is a very collaborative field, so being able to communicate both digitally and face-to-face with teammates is important. You need to be a good listener, be receptive to feedback, and share your ideas in a clear way.

#### Specialist and Generalist Designers

![Graphic representation of different types of designers.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qglhcITmR5aJYXCE5qeWeA_b0f22b91196d40198fdba42bf8939541_Screenshot-2021-03-02-at-11.09.03-PM.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=tqBTiv3yMgVUkETHSSOwCg_kCoE1rw0WnX2TnJbODpM)

##### Specialist: 

A specialist dives deep into one type of UX design, like interaction, visual, or motion design, and becomes an expert. Specialist UX designers are more common at large companies that have a lot of designers, like here at Google. Some of the benefits of becoming a specialist include:

- Focusing on one type of design that you enjoy more than others.
- Gaining deep knowledge of one type of design.
- Becoming well-known in the industry for your expertise in a particular type of design.

##### Generalist: 

A generalist has a broad number of responsibilities. A majority of UX design jobs are generalist positions, especially at companies with fewer UX designers. Typically, entry-level UX designers work in generalist roles, and some people choose to stay in generalist design roles for their entire careers. There are a lot of benefits to being a generalist UX designer, like: 

- Expanding your skills in many different types of UX work.
- Trying a variety of responsibilities and finding an area of UX that you’re especially passionate about. 
- Keeping your job feeling fresh and new, while doing a variety of tasks.

![Graphic representation of T shaped designer, who has deep knowledge on visual design.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/213RsksNT-6d0bJLDa_upw_c073c7820c9e488a90b34337addde7d8_Screenshot-2021-03-02-at-11.09.24-PM.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=1EvFFeHha3F9Dnz00AWawFnFXEBZtACn7h9ue5l93Ko)

##### T-shaped: 

A T-shaped designer is a specialist who also  has a lot of capabilities in other areas. T-shaped designers get their  name because the stem (or vertical line) of a T represents their  expertise in one area, while the top (or horizontal line) symbolizes  their related skills in a broad number of areas. T-shaped designers are  great to have on your team, since they come with the benefits of both  specialists and generalists. The image below highlights some of the  skills a T-shaped UX designer might have. In this example, the person is a visual design specialist but also has knowledge in other areas, like  coding and prototyping.

### Interact with cross-functional team

UX design a collaborative field, where designers typically work in cross-functional teams.

#### Teams that UX Designers work with

##### 1. Engineer

![Graphic of a person with long hair in a wheelchair, holding a laptop and smiling. Underneath, text says "engineer".](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vHkZueQ0Rr25GbnkNEa91g_44be8545247e48a588ce1e8b8bdbc227_UX_C1_M1_L2_R2_A.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=drmsdWK1mjXEDOMp1x0Wgvrxml0y_DWM6f_mCjj6h2Y)

Engineers translate designs into a functioning experience, like an app or a website. They help UX teams figure out if designs are feasible from a technical standpoint and bring that idea to life. Working closely with engineers and involving them early in the design process is critical to ensure your project is set up for success. 

##### 2. UX Researcher

![Graphic of a person in a hijab, holding a clipboard and a pencil. Underneath, text reads "UX Researcher"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/1asSIomLSjKrEiKJi_oyRg_80608e849efe4ef2a0129e0d5ec8d89a_UX_C1_M1_L2_R2_B.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=UfMWTJ1Ss6ZUZPnqQmj09ed1XyhwZKiph-rWU83i_Ak)

 UX research is all about understanding what users need and expect from  your product. UX researchers use methods like observations, interviews,  and surveys to understand users' unique perspectives. Findings from  research can inform your design decisions each step of the way. If you  work at a startup or small business, there’s a good chance you’ll get to do your own UX research. At larger companies though, you’ll likely work with designated UX researchers who will provide research findings to  inform your design work.

##### 3. Product Manager

![Program manager](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/oQcixZynSMmHIsWcp7jJnA_0e9fad9531bf40e889256cd7d7b07765_Screen-Shot-2021-04-08-at-12.09.39-AM.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=wia7taLrC8oPCdTVUIR87pX3OZtYhtAOuvoUF1X0DQc)

Program managers ensure clear and timely communication across the team, so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish. Program managers supervise, support, and keep track of the project as a whole. They assign tasks to team members, monitor the project budget, and manage timelines, among other things. Think of your team’s program manager as your go-to source of support when facing any setbacks or issues with your work.

##### 4. Product Lead

![Image of a person with short hair,  next to an image of a webpage. Text underneath reads "product lead"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/o8ZpFrJPSViGaRayT_lYgA_31bbc9e8d32b4728ba13bf4c761cd415_UX_C1_M1_L2_R2_D.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=_3iZ7ouTx13XdBIqDva_Nvu3ZP3nkxNjEXL_V3vbFT0)

Product leads are in charge of ensuring the final product’s success and communicating with stakeholders. Your product lead will define the project’s core goals and deliverables, so you can focus on creating innovative design solutions. At some companies, product leads are known as product managers.

##### 5. Other UX Designers

![Person with short hair sitting at a desk in front of a computer, text underneath reads "other UX designers"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/zPDIgc7EScSwyIHOxHnEVQ_3f346dde1ba549cc927cf95589a3cb1e_UX_C1_M1_L2_R2_E.png?expiry=1624752000000&hmac=5iDyjAWNYweEI4zNqaeI50k6Z5C3WihOmlYNCy554xI)

In many cases, you won’t be the sole designer working on a given project, especially if you work at a larger company and when you're a new designer. For example, as an entry-level UX designer, you might collaborate with a more experienced visual designer who can ensure that your designs adhere to the company’s brand standards for things like color and font. Working with other designers is a great chance to learn and ask questions!

>
> - Do you enjoy a lot of structure and processes, or do you like to define your own work and schedule? 
> - Do you value working on a big team, or are you more comfortable working alone? 
> - Do you want to focus mainly on UX design, or are you interested in broadening your skill set? 
>
> Considering your career goals and how you work best will help you start to figure out the kind of company that might be the best fit for you. Good luck!

## Part 4 - Pursue a Career in UX Design

___

### From Certificate to Career Success 

1. Internship
   short-term job with limited responsibility, short-term for example 6 months
2. Apprenticeship
   on-the-job training to help you develop real skills, long-term for example 1-2 years
3. Entry-Level
   roles that does not require any experience in the field. When an entry level job demands a minimum 1 year experience, sometime your portfolio and your certificate is enough to land it. So don't shy away from applying.
4. Freelancing
   work for a person, small businesses, or contribute to nonprofit in exchange for portfolio 

# Week 2 - Getting to know common terms, tools, and frameworks in UX Design

## Part 1 - Talk like a UX Designer

### Define the user, end-user, and user experience

#### User

any person that uses a product

#### End-User

The specific audience a UX-designer creates something for

> Our goal as UX Designer is to create product that benefits the end-user from their perspective and design an experience that meet their needs 

#### User Experience

How a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product

#### Goals of User Experience

- Is the product easy to use?
- Is the product equitable?
- Does the product delight the user?
- Does it solve the user's problem?

> As a UX Designer you focus on the end-user and meet their needs.
> Your team members might prioritize other goals for a product, like sales or marketing. 
> And some stakeholders might forget the fact that they are not the end user. 
> That's why you, as a UX designer, need to keep the end user as your main priority. 

### Prioritize the user

Why is it important that designs are centered on the user? 

> Because the user buys and uses your product. In addition, it's also important to solve problems that people actually experience, rather than only trying to solve problems you personally experience. Focusing on real user problems reduces the impact of designer bias. 

#### User-Centered Design

focuses on the user front-and-center. User-Centered Design have 4 steps:

1. Understand
2. Specify
3. Design
4. Evaluate

![image-20210626113211592](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210626113211592.png)

#### Iteration

Iteration means doing something again, by building on previous versions and making tweaks.

## Part 2 - Think like a UX Designer

### Key frameworks in UX Design

Five elements of key design:

1. Strategy
   define user need and business objective
2. Scope
   what we are building - feature and content to be included
3. Structure
   how to organize your design
4. Skeleton
   the layout
5. Surface
   top level User Experience - how the product looks to the user

![image-20210626153235302](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210626153235302.png)

Design Thinking have 5 actual steps:

1. Empathize
   discovery what user really needs, and to think and how to act like them

2. Define
   create a clear problem statement 

3. Ideate
   brainstorm solution, by focusing on quality not quantity

4. Prototype
   scale down of product that shows function

5. Test
   gives user an opportunity for feedback before product is built

   ![image-20210626153850103](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210626153850103.png)

The three most used design frameworks are:

1. User-Centered Design Process,
2. Five Elements of Key Design,
3. Design Thinking

### Think like a designer: User-Centered Design, 5 elements of UX Design, & Design Thinking Process

> Most UX designers follow a specific framework or process when approaching their work, from the first idea all the way through to the final launch of a product. As a reminder, a **framework** creates the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you’re trying to solve, kind of like an outline for a project. 

#### User-Centered Design Process

Each phase of the user-centered design process focuses on users and their needs. It's an **iterative** process.
At the core of the user-centered design process is a deep empathy for the user. It's not just about what a product does for a user, it's about how the experience of interacting with the design makes the user *feel*

![Diagram showing the key steps of the user-center design process. Arrows show progression in order, but they also circle back.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/pN87KCz0QOKfOygs9NDipg_2d2a3bb220c54a6bae8bb16a0c175912_UX_C1_M2_L2_R1_A.png?expiry=1624838400000&hmac=rZKDc7E0kJeBSUKQTEriyUE6NUEfb4i4XSjJv6igl4w)

##### Key Steps for the user-centered design process

| USER-CENTERED DESIGN PROCESS | KEY STEPS                                                    | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.                           | Understand how the user experiences the product.             | You want to know how users will engage with your design, as well as the environment or context in which they’ll experience the product. Understanding this requires a lot of research, like observing users in action and conducting interviews, which we’ll explore more later. |
| 2.                           | Specify the user's needs                                     | Based on your research, figure out which user problems are the most important to solve. |
| 3.                           | Design Solutions                                             | Come up with lots of ideas for designs that can address the user problems you’ve identified. Then, start to actually design those ideas! |
| 4.                           | Evaluate the solutions you designed against the user's needs | Ask yourself, does the design I created solve the user’s problem? To answer this question, you should test the product you designed with real people and collect feedback. |

##### Guiding principles for the user-centered design process

| USER-CENTERED DESIGN PROCESS | GUILDING PRINCIPLES              | DESCRIPTION                                                  |
| :--------------------------: | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|              1.              | Design for users and their needs | It can be tempting to design something in a certain way because it looks cool or solves one of your own problems, but it’s essential to keep in mind that you are *not* the end user. You're designing to help a diverse set of humans with specific needs. |
|              2.              | Make your copy conversational    | The writing within your product design should have a friendly, simple, and easily accessible tone. Avoid jargon or overly-complicated terminology that users might not understand. |
|              3.              | Present all information clearly  | Users should be able to navigate your product design easily and without assistance from others. Make key information, like checkout buttons, simple to find and identify. |
|              4.              | Acknowledge user actions         | Your product should let users know when they’ve executed a task correctly. That might be as simple as having a new window pop up when an icon is pressed, or as complex as animated tossed confetti to demonstrate that the user has accomplished a task. |
|              5.              | Offer support                    | As UX designers, our goal is to make designs accessible and understandable to every user, but sometimes we fall a bit short. Offer users a safety net, like a support center or list of Frequently Asked Questions. Make sure a frustrated user doesn’t have to swipe and click all over the product to find help |

> It’s also important to have empathy for yourself and your design team throughout the user-centered design process. When you’re trying to improve the user experience, you’ll inevitably fail at some point. That’s okay! It’s disappointing when a design fails, but there’s no reason to feel defeated. Learning from that experience will give you the tools and the understanding to try again.

### Think like a designer: lean UX and Double Diamond

#### Lean UX

The Lean UX process focuses on reducing wasted time and resources, and producing a workable as soon as possible. The process is iterative.

![A circle formed by 3 arrows; between them, the words THINK, MAKE, CHECK in a loop](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/LoTVh-MXRrqE1YfjFwa6VA_84ea0180d9af4f58ae003ec3df328fa2_Screenshot-2021-03-02-at-11.36.43-PM.png?expiry=1624838400000&hmac=H_poOoN7q1w52k75KRHr6gFSYDQvRCxuW03gDF0h2w8)

Lean process has 3 steps:

1. Think
   Explore the problems that users are experiencing and consider how you could solve them with your design
   This step is all about gathering research, so you can form a clear idea of who the product is for and how it will help them
2. Make
   Start designing the product by creating sketches, wireframes, and prototypes.
   You'll also create a minimum viable product, or MVP for short, which is a simple prototype of your designs that you can test with your target audience. Be prepared to go back and update your prototype as you gather feedback
3. Check
   Find out how users respond to your design and gather feedback from project stakeholders
   Make adjustments to your design accordingly, repeat the three steps

> These steps are meant to be repeated as many times as possible, until your team reaches the desired final product. It encourages productivity and collaboration. Furthermore, Lean UX teams are typically cross-functional.

There are six principles when using the Lean UX Process:

| Lean UX Process | Principles                       | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.              | Move Forward                     | Focus only on design elements and features that move the design process toward a particular goal. Don’t get distracted by “nice-to-haves.” |
| 2.              | Stay Curious                     | Leaning UX is about using feedback from users and stakeholders to revise and improve your designs. Continuously seek feedback to understand why specific design choices work or don’t work. |
| 3.              | Test ideas in the real world     | Lean UX encourages designers to test their ideas - using prototypes, for example - outside of the conference room and with potential users. |
| 4.              | Externalize your ideas           | Instead of internally debating and analyzing whether or not an idea is going to work, turn your ideas into something physical, viewable, and testable, while they’re still fresh in your mind. This way, you’ll get feedback on your designs in the early stages, when diverse perspectives and feedback are most helpful. |
| 5.              | Reframe deliverables as outcomes | Focus on creating usable, enjoyable products that users actually want and need. Always keep in mind that you’re designing for your users first-and-foremost, not for the project stakeholders. |
| 6.              | Embrace Radial Transparency      | Feel comfortable being honest with everyone on the team (and expect the same in return), since you will depend on each other’s insights. This way, everyone can make informed decisions about how to move forward and avoid wasting time and energy. |

> Lean UX is about collaborating and incorporating feedback

#### Double Diamond

Double Diamond is a more traditional UX process, which breaks down UX design into two main phases (or “diamonds”): research and design

![A visual of the design process](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vO_Y3qYRSI-v2N6mEbiPHA_a66aebbde23443c9a1d2504ef67e899e_Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.54.45-AM.png?expiry=1624838400000&hmac=F-9z2MjZM8SbpLnidc-RTieDk66KbhqtiWozi_GVhiE)

Each has 2 steps, when combined there are 4 steps.

| Double Diamond | Steps                             | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Research    | Discover the problem              | Gather information about potential users are facing          |
|                | Define the problem                | Filter through the data, and focus on the main issue your product aims to solve |
| 2. Design      | Develop solutions for the problem | Begin designing your product as a work in progress.<br />This is where wireframes and prototypes come into play |
|                | Deliver the product               | Review and test your product to prepare it for release       |

> Double Diamond is iterative, not linear. Each sprints leads the team to new insights that are used to improve the product's design. Double Diamond also encourages teamwork across the organization, so the design doenst solely focus on design.

There are 4 principles that inform the Double Diamond process

| Double Diamond | Principles        | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.             | Focus on the user | As is always the case in UX design, the user is the top priority. |
| 2.             | Communicate       | Communicate visually, through imagery and design choices that supplement the text. You should also be sure that the communication of your design is equitable and accessible, which you'll learn more about in this part of the program. |
| 3.             | Collaborate       | One of the unique features of the Double Diamond process is that it encourages creative collaboration and co-creation with your fellow team members. |
| 4.             | Iterate           | Accept that the design is a work in progress and isn’t going to be complete right away. The magic is in the revision. With every iteration, you give the user a new experience. |

### Universal design, inclusive design, and equity-focused design

#### Universal Design
is the process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of situations

> One size fits all isn't a great solution

#### Inclusive Design

Making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like:

- Ability
- Race
- Economic status
- Language
- Age
- Gender

> Exclusive Design: One size fits all
> Inclusive Design: Solve for one, Extend to many

#### Accessibility

The design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities

#### Equity-focused design

Designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building a products

> Equality is Providing the same level of support
> Equity is Providing different levels of opportunity and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcomes

### The importance of accessibility

#### Accessibility

The design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities.
It is commonly known as a11y (11 comes from the letter after a until the last letter)

#### Accessibility Categories

1. Motor
2. Deaf or hard of hearing
3. Cognitive / Mental / Learning
4. Visual
5. Concurrent (more than 1 Accessibility)

> - More than one billion in the world have accessibility / 30% from the total population in the world have accessibility.
> - In US 1 out of 4 have accessibility (but demographics can be misleading)
> - In the disability community and as UX designers, we focus on the social model of disability, which defines a disability as being caused by the way society is organized or how products are designed rather than a person's ability or difference. 

As designer we need to account for:

1. Permanent
2. Temporary Impairment
   after a loud concert, broke their arm
3. Situational Challenges
   driving on the dark road, a foreigner cant understand the language

> Here's the key takeaway: If we make the design of a product easier for people with disabilities, we also often make it a better experience for everyone else. Designing for accessibility isn't an obstacle, but a way to get our products to as many users as possible.

### Design for Accessibility

> Accessibility in design allows users of diverse abilities to navigate, understand, and use your product. Start to familiarize yourself with design principles that keep accessibility front-and-center by reviewing the [Accessibility Guide for Google Material](https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html). Don’t worry if the topics outlined in this guide are advanced or unfamiliar. We’ll cover each of them in more detail as you progress through this certificate program!

### The importance of equity-focused design

#### Equity focused design

Thinking through all the aspects of a designed product and making sure the product is both accessible and fair to all genders, races, and abilities. Plus the designs need to specifically consider the underrepresented and excluded groups

The example below will create a far more accurate data compared with options available only for <u>Male, Female, Non Binary</u>

- Male
- Female
- Gender non-conforming (means having a gender identity that doesn't conform to a society's gender norms.)
- Non binary
- Other: <u>[fill in the blank]</u>

## Part 3 - Consider the Next Billion Users

### Design for Next Billion Users (NBU)

The next billion users are the future generations of internet users, and they will likely use the internet and products differently from their predecessors!

Issue with NBU: 

1. Cost
   might be expensive, tend to buy less expensive 
2. Connectivity
   some rural areas doenst have internet access
3. Digital literacy
   not familiar with CTA, not knowing how to download, etc
4. Literacy
   unable to read/ type, different language

### A perspective on the Next Billion Users

> The strange thing about UX design is that you won't really notice if it's good design.
> You only notice it when it's bad
>
> It's not about if you are new or old when it comes to technology

## Part 4 - Work like a UX Designer

### The advantage of UX design tools

1. Tools allows designers to prototype ideas and iterate on them
2. Tools make it easier for designers to test their prototypes
3. Design tools make it possible for multiple teams to work on the same product

### The UX Design toolbox

#### Wireframing and prototyping tools

Early in your UX design career, you’ll likely spend a lot of time creating wireframes and prototypes. 

- A **wireframe** is an outline or a sketch of a product or a screen. Wireframes help designers figure out how a page is arranged, where each piece of a product fits in with the others, and how users will likely interact with the product.
- A **prototype** is an early model of a product that demonstrates functionality. 

![A person with long hair stands in front of toolbox holding a laptop. Text above reads wireframing and prototyping tools](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/WAuDNDIvRIGLgzQyLzSB4A_f5a95526c9f742d1a2a0040c429a2ddd_UX_C1_M2_L3_R1_B.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=2CprUVirF1YNEHyGBBaoBMv2vC2BEc130xXPl3x5nqw)

There are tons of digital tools available to help you design wireframes and prototypes. Here are four of the most popular tools:

- [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/design/) is a widely used, all-in-one wireframing and prototyping tool that allows for real-time collaboration among multiple team members. This makes Figma ideal for designers working remotely and for teams with members in different locations. Figma is versatile and customizable, with plenty of features to speed up the design process. *You will have free access to Figma as a learner in the Google UX Design Certificate, and you will learn more about Figma in Courses 3 and 5 of this program.*
- [**Adobe XD**](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) is great for editing graphics, building prototypes, and collaborating with other people on your team. It has particularly robust features for tasks that happen during the later stages of UX design, as you get into what we call high-fidelity designs. *You will have free access to Adobe XD as a learner in the Google UX Design Certificate, and you will learn more about Adobe XD in Course 6 of this program.*
- [**Sketch**](https://www.sketch.com/) is another popular wireframing and prototyping tool in the UX community. Unlike some of the other tools you’ll encounter, Sketch is only available on Apple’s operating system, macOS. 
- *Bonus:* [**Framer**](https://www.framer.com/why-framer/) is arguably one of the most advanced UX design tools. Designers can use Framer to develop prototypes and animations from scratch. The tool is also a great option for cross-team collaboration, and it allows you to import designs created in Sketch or Figma. 

#### Presentation Tools

During the early, conceptual phases of the design process, you don’t always need to use tools that were specifically made for UX design. In fact, some designers prefer working within the relative simplicity of presentation programs, especially when they’re creating wireframes. 

![A person holding a megaphone stands in front of a toolbox. Text above reads "presentation tools"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/47chKqfSTdC3ISqn0u3QAw_8370e05bc7e9469b9907cd4940464d5e_UX_C1_M2_L3_R1_C.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=1XHG3slmdBZAhVEf2jSBVGBoVD-i3xDol9Y_17-gWkM)

Most presentation tools also have live collaboration features, so team members can interact with each other and collaborate on the designs. Here are three of the most popular presentation tools from Google, Microsoft, and Apple:

- [**Google Slides**](https://workspace.google.com/products/slides/) is a web-based presentation program included in Google Workspace, Google’s suite of productivity software. Google Slides is free, and anyone with a Google account can create or edit Slides presentations.
- [**Microsoft PowerPoint**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint) was one of the first presentation programs created, and it’s still very widely used. PowerPoint is part of the Microsoft 365 program package and comes in both offline and online versions. Although anyone can view a PowerPoint presentation online, you have to own the product to create or edit a presentation.
- [**Keynote**](https://www.apple.com/keynote/) is Apple’s presentation program, and a lot of people consider its templates to be the most visually appealing. It’s also available both online and offline. Although Keynote was created for Apple devices like Macs and iPads, it can be used on a PC, as well. Similar to PowerPoint, you have to own the product to make edits or create new presentations in Keynote.

#### Image Creation and Manipulation Tools

As you develop your designs, you might need to use tools to create, manipulate, and integrate images and illustrations. 

![A person holding a camera and scissors and standing in front of a toolbox. Text above: image creation and manipulation tools](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Uja0Ht0FQPe2tB7dBWD35A_b37a556819254e09843f01f7dac446a6_UX_C1_M2_L3_R1_D.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=wFvqMmc0DjURPapLaJDsB8g6IBfdcxhDXe_vTF8NCvg)

Here are two of the most popular image creation and manipulation tools: 

- [**Adobe Illustrator**](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) is primarily used for drawing vector images. **Vector images** (or SVGs) are images created using points, curves, lines, and shapes to produce perfectly smooth lines. This makes it easy to edit and resize images in Illustrator. As an entry-level UX designer, you can use Adobe Illustrator to draw prototypes and illustrations for your designs.
- [**Adobe Photoshop**](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) works primarily with photos, known as raster images. These images are composed of thousands, or even millions, of pixels, the smallest unit of display on a computer screen. While its cousin Illustrator is a better tool for creating an image from scratch, Photoshop has more uses, including image manipulation across file types, saving images for digital publishing, and even presentations.

#### Animation Tools

Creating animations can be a great way to showcase the more interactive elements of your designs. For example, you could create a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) to demonstrate how a user might interact with the homepage of an app you’re designing

![A person holding a slate while standing in front of a toolbox. Text above reads: animation tools](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/RqWPpmaqRfqlj6ZmqjX6aw_849beef1fcb6444abf50d12055664fa7_UX_C1_M2_L3_R1_E.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=0HHRkREvPh9zV3O2uuVBfkQRqdVsFPHHbbQk-22xEag)

There are many programs that UX designers can use to create animations, but here are a couple to highlight:

- [**Lottie**](https://lottiefiles.com/) is a tool that helps you edit and ship your animations in just a few clicks. Animation files formatted in Lottie, also known as LottieFiles, use less file space on your hard drive since they are code-based. On Lottie, you can also explore animations created by other designers for inspiration or use. 
- [**Adobe After Effects**](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html?sdid=KKQOW&mv=search&kw=test&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwuL_8BRCXARIsAGiC51CSU9gu_SrVG40X-2ClEFnFfKuEKYYQ4kOtlm6F3Y4Kon1hf5z6oSwaAvXLEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!469900475182!e!!g!!adobe after effects&gclid=Cj0KCQjwuL_8BRCXARIsAGiC51CSU9gu_SrVG40X-2ClEFnFfKuEKYYQ4kOtlm6F3Y4Kon1hf5z6oSwaAvXLEALw_wcB) is often used to add motion graphics and visual effects to designs. For example, UX designers might utilize Adobe After Effects to make text move across the screen or create transitions between pages.

## Part 5 - Design across platforms

### Get to know platforms

> Platform is a medium where users experience their product on.
> Example: Desktop, Tablet, Phone
>
> Today, most website are adjusted to Desktop and Phone
>
> Brand Identity is the visual appearance and voice of a company

### Design for different platforms

![image-20210628113133688](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210628113133688.png)

> There's a big difference in the amount of time users spend on mobile phones compared to desktop computers. An average mobile session is 72 seconds, while the average desktop session is 150 seconds, more than twice as long. 
>
> Why is this important?
>
> Because it tells us that people use different devices in different ways. 
> Mobile users tend to be goal-oriented, and they are focused on completing a single task. 
> On mobile phones, gestures like tapping and swiping help users move around the screen. 

Responsive web design allows the web to automatically adjust their website to change to different monitor size resolution

> Main takeaway: Users behave differently depending on their device

### Design cross-platform experiences

When designing a new product or feature, it’s important to think about the different types of platforms that the design will be experienced on. As a refresher, a **platform** is the medium that users experience your product on. Some common platforms are:

- Desktop computers
- Laptop computers
- Mobile phones
- Tablets
- Wearables, like smart watches
- TVs
- Smart displays

![Graphic of various portable devices such as laptops, tablets, smart phones, smart watches](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Mq3e5wUeTFmt3ucFHhxZZg_181dfe02d0cf4baf9cadc7f94d5ddbe9_UX_C1_M2_L4_R1_A.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=LZXP7muexfW9eAgdaSE7OWnQAobjvfnzOD8sh1uufgQ)

| Screen Size                                                  | Interaction                                                  | Context Layout                                               | Functionality                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| For example, you have a lot of screen space when you design for desktop and laptop computers. But when you design for smaller screens, like mobile phones, you have to carefully decide which parts of the design you'll prioritize including in the limited space. This means making every word, icon, and image count! | It’s also critical to consider accessibility when developing your designs at each point. Different groups of people will interact with your product in different ways, like using a screen reader, closed captioning, or a switch device. To get started, it’s helpful to try using some of these technologies yourself, in order to understand how people with disabilities might interact with your product on different platforms. | Consider the layout of content on a couple more platforms: tablets combine both the desktop and mobile phone user experience, which means you can incorporate aspects of desktop and mobile phone content layouts in your designs. Smartwatches tend to have compact square or rectangular screens, offering very little digital real estate to lay out content. | For example, a desktop computer might be the best platform when users need to get intensive work done across a long stretch of time. Alternatively, mobile phones are portable, making them ideal for more casual and immediate tasks like texting, emailing, and checking social media while on-the-go. |

## The four Cs of designing for multiple platforms

Successfully designing across platforms means providing users with a good experience, no matter what platform they use! As a UX designer, your job is to make sure that your designs account for and take full advantage of the unique features of each platform.

When preparing to design across platforms, it’s helpful to keep in mind the four Cs: 

1. Consistency,
2. Continuity, 
3. Context, and 
4. Complementary

![Graphic from the point of view of someone looking at their hands on a laptop. They are holding a phone and wearing a watch.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/IPOmc8cpQEezpnPHKdBHwg_29c01a4606ba444684f95567295c3dac_UX_C1_M2_L4_R1_B.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=6DHioqmqrCYse1mTh2o6noX1nHhFhfB2DL-_heS9i44)

**Consistency**: Most companies have specific design guidelines that need to be followed in order to stay consistent with their brand identity, which refers to the visual appearance and voice of a company. When designing a product, it’s essential to stay true to the company’s brand guidelines in order to maintain consistency across platforms and drive brand awareness. Maintaining a consistent design helps improve the user experience and build trust, because users can expect the design to feel familiar across platforms and products.

![A graphic of a laptop and a phone next to each other. On the laptop, there's an email draft. Same draft is on the phone.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/uoLYe2X2QYaC2Htl9pGGGQ_70f3a0614aa2406588102b472d1bc63c_UX_C1_M2_L4_R1_D.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=ioqgMRWULLdPfH0pahQMaM3uJns7E19HILdZ8mt8JnU)

**Continuity**: To provide users with a seamless experience as they move between platforms, UX designers also have to prioritize continuity. Continuity in design means that users can maintain their progress as they move from one platform to the next. The user experience for each platform might be slightly different, but the product’s functionality should still be connected. Without continuity, users can become frustrated if the progress of their experience does not carry across platforms.

![A graphic of a laptop screen next to a smart watch screen. Email appears on laptop, notification appears on the watch.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/0E_OtA5wSiKPzrQOcNoi2Q_d9ab9ab0777047b4ba58a175c6c4d42c_UX_C1_M2_L4_R1_C.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=MwHaEokqWJQXcQHE_4yaME1JyX19F_Bbgu9w34CiqbM)

**Context**: It’s also important to consider the context of each platform you’re designing for. This means thinking about when and how users prefer to interact with certain features on different platforms. 

![A graphic of a laptop next to a phone screen. On the laptop, hands are typing an email. On the phone, they are adding images](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Cjks7nuVSJ65LO57ldievg_50c146b60a264066aa2263a2d6b4c3ad_UX_C1_M2_L4_R1_E.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=x2HcJX2IzQjkjeBlR2Gl9HSojmQTIuYrK95QKHFduvw)

**Complementary**: One way to create a great cross-platform user experience is to make sure that the design of each platform adds something new for the user. 

#### Example of Cross Platform Experiences

| Youtube                                                      | WebMD                                                        | AirBnB                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The YouTube mobile viewing experience complements and smoothly transitions from a desktop browser. For example, the mobile app elevates YouTube’s “‘Watch History” feature, which allows users to continue watching from the place they left off in videos, on any device. In the mobile phone app, users can also access all of their playlists and upload videos directly to their channel, just like they would on a computer. | The WebMD “Symptom Checker” allows users to click on certain areas of a body map and get a list of possible symptoms associated with those body parts. On a mobile phone, this feature is simplified to account for the smaller screen size, but still provides the same basic functionality. On a desktop or laptop computer, this feature is more in-depth and extensive, and lays out the content differently. | The Airbnb user experience on a desktop computer is straightforward and similar to other rental sites, where you can filter your search based on your needs. The mobile app seamlessly integrates these same features and allows for continuity throughout the booking process. You can even get Airbnb notifications on your smartwatch, which is really handy as you’re traveling to your destination. |

### Assistive Technology (AT)

> Any products, equipment, and system that enhance learning, working, and daily living for people with disabilities

AT covers a lot of devices like:

1. E-Gadgets like: Monitor, Computer, Smartphone, Tablet
2. Prosthetics
3. Pointing Devices

2. Voice control
   Switch is an assistive technology device that replaces the need to use a computer keyboard or a mouse
3. Screen readers (most common with limited vision)
4. Alternative text
   help translate image to text

# Week 3 - Understand Design Sprints

## Part 1 - Understand Design Sprints

### Introduction to Design Sprints

> Everything around you starts with a Design Problem / Design Challenge.
>
> Design Sprints is a time-bound process, with five phases typically over 5 full 8-hour days
> Goal: Solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users
> Benefits: 
>
> - Save time
> - Create a path to bring product to market
> - Prioritize the user
> - Test product before launch 
>
> Ask these questions tp when to Sprint:
>
> - Many potential solutions to challenge?
> - Cross-functional teams needed to weigh in?
> - Challenge scope wide enough?
>
> If the the answer to all of the above is yes, then using a Design Sprint is a good idea

### Five Phases of Design Sprint 

> A Design Sprint usually lasts 5 days and each phase take 1 full day. 
> The whole process is super hands-on and creative collaboration is at the core of every phase.

![image-20210628123433844](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210628123433844.png)

#### 1. Understand the scope of the Design Challange

This phase sets your sprint on the right track and helps your team get a clear picture of the design challenge.
Your team takes time to learn from experts and engage in creative discussions with a lot of different people from other departments and industries. These conversations help you more clearly understand the design challenge.

> But what's the first rule of UX design? The user comes first. 
> This means everything your team does during the sprint should focus on the user. 
> So now your team understands the design challenge.

#### 2. Ideate Possible Solutions

Your team arrives for phase two of the design sprint, pumped full of inspiration and ready to ideate some solutions.

To get the creative juices flowing, you start this phase by coming up with ideas and building off of them to create solutions. Once you've got the team thinking, each participant takes time to sketch and present their ideas. 
Don't worry about your drawing skills here, the idea is what matters.

On top of all the ideating that happens in phase two, you also need to start planning for user testing, which happens in phase five of the sprint. During user testing, you'll have a diverse group of people test your product and provide feedback. To be able to do this, you need to start recruiting users that fit your target profile now, so the sprint stays on schedule.

#### 3. Decide on the Most Viable Options

By the time you reach phase three, you have a lot of potential solutions for your design challenge. Now it's time to decide which solutions you want to build. 

Together, your team discusses each possible solution, and eventually decides on the one solution that is most likely to excite users and increase sales.

#### 4. Create a Workable Prototype

Finally, you'll wrap up the day by creating a step-by-step blueprint for your prototype. 

You're now ready to build the first version of your new app feature. At the end of this phase, you don't need a finished product, just something realistic enough to test with users. 

By focusing only on what the user experiences on their screen, your team creates a working prototype of the new customized routes feature. Way to go! During this phase, you also finish prepping for user testing by confirming the test schedule, finalizing interview questions, and making sure your prototype is good to go.

#### 5. Test that Prototype with Actual Users

Now it's time to put your prototype in front of users.

As users test your prototype, you observe how they react and then interview them about their experiences. Your team gains critical insight about changes that need to be made before you launch the new feature.

## Part 4 - Reflect on Design Sprints

### Common Retrospective Question

Every design sprint is an opportunity for your team to learn something new. This is especially useful for entry-level UX designers joining a design sprint for the first time. During a design sprint, the focus is on:

1. Understand design challenge
2. Ideating solution
3. Deciding which solutions to build
4. Prototyping a few solutions
5. Testing these prototypes

Immediately after, your team should hold a retrospective. 

> A **retrospective** is a collaborative critique of the design sprint.
> The goal of a retrospective is to make sure everyone who took part in the sprint has the chance to give feedback and think about opportunities for improvement. 

The key questions are:

1. What went well?
2. What can be improved?

#### 1. What went well?

![A graphic of a shining trophy with the text "what went well?" written underneath](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/9OotYFvaReaqLWBb2sXm3A_54b9a6560c604002a17dfd8ebafced07_UX_C1_M3_L4_R1_A.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=aB8EhQULvhJSRrIGWnvia_EoznEv9gYz08UHAcasISI)

Start the retrospective by discussing the parts of the design sprint that were successful and areas where the team did well. Maybe a new process was created that could be applied to future sprints. Or maybe the addition of a new digital tool enhanced the team’s productivity. Analyze your team’s wins, and think about how they could be applied to future sprints.

> Questions you might ask during this part of the retrospective include:
>
> - Which tools saved you the most time and effort?
> - When did you feel the most satisfaction?
> - What helped you make your best contribution to the team during this sprint?
>
> This is also a good time to acknowledge a team member’s strong performance. Celebrating successes builds relationships and increases cohesion and harmony within the team!

#### 2. What can be improved?

After highlighting everything that went well, it’s time to shift gears and think about areas for improvement. Your team will want to know what went wrong, so that you all can do better next time. 

Encourage everyone to participate in sharing areas for improvement. You might even take turns going around a circle and adding challenges to a shared list. If anyone is nervous about speaking up, invite each person to write their thoughts anonymously on individual sticky notes. Then, all of the improvements can be reviewed together. This eliminates concerns about causing offense and reduces the chance of groupthink. 

**Groupthink** can occur in a group discussion when one person shares an opinion and everyone immediately agrees with the opinion, instead of sharing their own feelings about a topic. Groupthink prevents each person from having an equal say, and it might mean certain areas for improvement are overlooked.

![An icon of a light bulb with a green check mark overlaid. Text underneath reads "what can be improved?"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/P5nNlutzQDmZzZbrc3A5HA_67dede15196e447a9f92e88f8a2f29d1_UX_C1_M3_L4_R1_B.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=HZ_Qf_x0_V73B0QTjozfdn3ergXF2HajxCcyYQO0ujA)

> Questions to ask during retrospective includes:
>
> - What went wrong that caught you off guard?
> - Which problems came up the most often?
> - When do you think we experienced the biggest challenge as a team?
>
> Then, examine the sprint’s outcome or final product, and ask questions like: 
>
> - Did the team overestimate or underestimate the work required to complete the design? 
> - Did an external factor derail your productivity? 
> - And most importantly, does the final design actually solve the user problem? 
>
> Keep in mind, retrospectives are about empowering, not shaming. This is not the time to call out an individual for poor performance. If you have issues with a team member’s work, it’s best to address it with that person privately, not during a team-wide retrospective.

#### 3. Lessons Learned

By the end of the retrospective meeting, your team will have a better understanding of what went well and what could be improved. Naturally, you’ll want to take lessons learned into your next design sprint. 

Before your next sprint, review the conclusions you reached at the end of the last retrospective. Your conclusions should inform how you conduct the next sprint. Perhaps you need to include a more diverse team, allow more time for ideating, or test with additional users before moving forward with a design.

![An icon of a file, a piece of paper and a pencil. Text underneath reads "lessons learned"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/BxjP6x15QYSYz-sdedGEuw_9ddf37fe1a984670b56d1da87763b259_UX_C1_M3_L4_R1_C.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=hB8rN9H7VMQTqE_RseZZW1WGENH7skZJTHW3TnQ7_CI)

Questions you might ask include:

- What did you discover during the sprint that you’re still wondering about?
- How could the current process be holding the team back from creating better solutions?

## Part 2 - Start a UX Design Portfolio 

### Introduction to Website Builders

Popular Website Builders are:

1. WiX
2. Squarespace
3. Webflow
4. Google Sites
5. Code your own

> Use your own Domain for your own personal branding
> You can get your own domain here: [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/),[ Hostgator](https://www.hostgator.com/), or[ Google Domains](https://domains.google/?utm_medium=product&utm_source=GWG&utm_campaign=gwg_q4&utm_content=uxdesigncert). 

### Plan your portfolios website

To help you get started, check out this list of elements to include in your portfolio website. You might have noticed these tips in action when you reviewed examples of entry-level UX designer portfolios earlier in the course!

![person smiling while using a computer near a window](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/F2F0tPbkQs-hdLT25KLPFA_2d240ea8e5ae4be99bb902f6c540fccf_Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-12.05.39-AM.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=fXVxLk98tPpetrodUCcW0XlEfdqG8I9P7UlgtPhXV8k)

1. **Name and personal logo** (if you have one). 
   Clearly list your name at the top of your portfolio website to help visitors easily identify whose work they are reviewing. If you have a personal logo, like a simple icon or a stylized version of your initials, you should consider including that alongside your name, too.
2. **Navigation menu.** 
   Navigation is how users move from page to page on a website. Keep the navigation on your portfolio website simple and easy to follow. For example, users should be able to reach the homepage of your portfolio website from any part of your site, and your navigation titles should be clear and accurate.
3. **Work samples.** 
   The focus of your portfolio website is to highlight samples of your UX design work. For example, you will create three projects during this certificate program that you can showcase on your portfolio website. When planning your portfolio website, be sure to choose a layout that will let work samples shine!
4. **“About Me”.** 
   Plan to create a page on your portfolio website where visitors learn more about your interests, experiences, and passions. You'll create an "About Me" page for your portfolio website in an upcoming activity of the course. 
5. **Contact information.** 
   On your portfolio website, it's helpful to provide information about how people can contact you. For example, you should provide your email address, a link to your resume, and links to your professional online profiles (like LinkedIn), so visitors can contact you about potential job opportunities. Wherever possible, try to use professional-looking naming, like an email address of [YourName]@gmail.com. You can plan to include your contact information in different parts of your portfolio website, like a dedicated page or across the top, bottom, or side of your portfolio website.
6. **Color scheme**. 
   The colors in your portfolio can provide a more engaging user experience, and should reflect your personality and personal brand. We suggest selecting a small set of colors that work well together, like one primary color and one accent color. The goal of the colors is to support your content and personal brand, not distract from it. 

> Map your website's content
>
> A quick sketch of what your portfolio website could look like can give you a better idea of the right template to use from a website builder. All you need is a pen or pencil and paper to sketch out a basic layout of important pages. 
>
> As you map the content of your portfolio website, consider answers to these questions: 
>
> 1. What will you include on your portfolio homepage? 
> 2. What elements, if any, do you want to include together?
> 3. How many pages overall will you need, and what should you title each page?

### Introduction to best practices for UX Design Portfolios

Tips for a good UX Design Portfolio:

1. Personal Brand
   The way in which your personality, unique skills, and value as a designer intersect with your public persona
   Should clearly demonstrate who you are and what makes you interesting

2. Tell a Story
   from the Beginning, Middle, and End

3. Be concise
   Add links to other pages or PDFs

4. Keep your navigation simple and intuitive
   Navigation is the way users go to another page,
   Home and contact should be easy to contact
   Contact should include your name, email, and social medias

5. Go Beyond Template
   Don't use the 100% template, use domains 

6. Include diversity of a project

7. #### Feature case studies

   ___

   A case study leads the user through your design process, from the beginning to the end. 
   Your portfolio should feature case studies, not just mockups of design ideas. 

   A case study answers these questions: 

   - What was the problem you were trying to solve? 
   - What process did you follow?
   - Where did you succeed or fail? 
   - What insights informed your design decisions along the way? 
   - What was the ultimate solution, 
   - and why do you feel that solution was the best? 

   When describing case studies, you might want to include things like:  

   - the project's name and duration, 
   - your role on the design team, 
   - including your personal contributions to the project, 
   - the project's goal, 
   - the research that was conducted, 
   - the intended audience, 
   - any sketches or wireframes, 
   - user testing results, 
   - the final design, and 
   - a conclusion about what you learned in the process. 

   > One more thing to keep in mind about case studies: 
   >
   > Be careful not to share any proprietary information or break a nondisclosure agreement, if you have one. 
   > A nondisclosure agreement is a contract an employee might sign when working with a business, in which they agree not to share sensitive information, like designs in the process of being developed.

   ___

8. Make sure your website is responsive

9. Test your website

### Activity: Start your Online Portfolio

![image-20210628175134852](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210628175134852.png)

#### My Code Portfolio Website

> Link here

### Collect portfolio elements

> You haven’t started your first design project yet, but when you do, you'll need to showcase all of the work you do for the project in your portfolio. As you start working on design projects, document everything that could be a potential portfolio artifact. This includes taking photos of your notes, sticky notes, wireframes, prototypes, and even you and your teammates working together. The photos in your portfolio should always be high quality, which means the images should be clear, crisp, and easy to read. Believe it or not, those scraps of paper and work doodles are an important part of your thought process! And it’s nice to present your work in action with photos. 

Here are a tips you need to know before you begin your first design project: 

1. Scan anything with a printer or a scanner
2. Screenshot wireframes and prototypes
3. Get permission

## Part 3 - Start to develop a personal brand and online presence

### Explore personal brands

Figuring out your personal brands by answering these questions

- What am I naturally good at?
- What have I learned to do well?
- What do I enjoy?
- What do I value?
- How do other people describe me and my talents?
- What do people want to recognize me for?

> Personal Brand is important to show company if your values fit on that company

### Review examples of strong personal brands

| Description | Oprah Winfrey has created one of the most recognizable personal brands in history. She became a household name by using consistent branding across all of her platforms and products, like the Oprah Winfrey Show, Oprah Radio, and *O* Magazine. Oprah shares inspiring messages with her audience, which has led to real change in people’s lives | Sarah Cooper is a comedian and author, who also happens to be a former Google employee (and a UXer, at that!). Her website and blog perfectly mirror her sense of humor. All of the photos on Sarah’s website are lighthearted and poke fun at life, just like she does in her comedy skits and TikTok videos. | Bill Nye is a scientist and engineer who’s famous for making science fun and engaging. His brand is solidified by his fun theme song for his show, *Bill Nye the Science Guy*. All of his content and television appearances focus on science, but he presents it in a way that’s easy for anyone to understand. |

#### The big picture: brand yourself consistently

> When it comes to building your personal brand, consistency is key. Being consistent in how you present yourself personally and professionally communicates authenticity and builds trust among people in the design community. 
>
> Your personal brand is an essential way to demonstrate your value as a designer. Whatever your brand is, make sure that it’s specific, clear, and above all, consistent in all of your work.

### Start to develop a personal brand

Your personal brand should be recognizable across all of your online presence, such as your portfolio website, LinkedIn, and UX design community profiles like Dribbble and Behance, which you'll learn about soon. Here are some pro tips to help you start to develop your personal brand.

#### Create a Personal Logo

![An icon of a tablet with a design on it. Text underneath reads "create a personal logo"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/M30CUyE_TTW9AlMhP601Zg_93014a3431de463591878032de227f0c_UX_C1_M4_L3_R2_A.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=8ilV1PHqhOpj-cOLihLvyJuFUALdDbADvzY19RUKRuk)

A logo that speaks to you and your work is a great way to provide a quick visual of what you’re all about. While a personal logo is not required, it helps you leave a lasting impression and makes your personal brand easily recognizable. Make your logo as sleek or as quirky as you’d like, as long as it accurately reflects you as a designer! For example, your logo could build upon your initials or a symbol that represents your personality. Your personal logo should be included in your portfolio, on your social media accounts, and on your business cards, if you have them. 

#### Make the most of Colors and Fonts

![Graphic of colorful paint swatches with text underneath that reads "make the most of fonts and colors"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/cwSwOWbZSHSEsDlm2eh0rQ_b0ba619bbf6044fbadd3d6ae06d5d623_UX_C1_M4_L3_R2_D.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=fwC3GJN5z4EYZC35ifXQba7vjaRsONmLTxa5iqw-3WM)

Be sure that the font and color scheme you choose to represent yourself are in line with the way you want people to think of you as a UX designer. It’s a good idea to use the same fonts and colors on your portfolio website, personal logo, resume and online profiles, in order to maintain consistency in your personal brand.

#### Keep your Voice Assistant

![A silhouette icon with text bubbles coming out, text underneath reads "Keep your voice consistent"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/kPzWIQzoTm281iEM6B5t6A_51e895bc226f4a3cb1d9e182a7ce4b38_UX_C1_M4_L3_R2_E.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=inxmhUhwJLgHiSyW8SK7-UcRuyr9Cw2DU9ndDwytcyA)

The written content that appears in your portfolio website and across your online profiles should have a similar voice. Your writing might be a bit more professional on your LinkedIn profile, but you want it to sound like the same person who’s writing in your portfolio. If your brand is relaxed and humorous, don’t be afraid to add a bit of that humor into your online profiles (where appropriate, of course).

#### Use graphics, animations, and photography

![Graphic icon of mountains and a video "play" button. Text underneath reads "use graphics, animations, and photography"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/h40g5QncRKWNIOUJ3PSlMg_816fc1a157094788a99e95e7bc7e80f4_UX_C1_M4_L3_R2_B.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=sH70Z61mYvZ0QR58Uutz9LmtcOm6Y7CCK9OqlntMiog)

Imagery is another great way to cultivate your personal brand. You can make your own graphics and animations to add personality to your online profiles and highlight important information. You can also showcase your personal brand through photography, by using a consistent style or editing photos in a similar way.

#### Be yourself

![An icon of a heart smiling and giving itself a hug with text underneath that reads "Be yourself"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/QYLD2xikSbqCw9sYpPm6Ow_0a95eac7d687488887ccf79419277d8d_UX_C1_M4_L3_R2_C.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=vQHsLNz4Y1sPeRgMQe30cvYEyqHuikjK8ouS1qhqvvs)

Being authentic to who you are means you are less likely to do and say things that are “off-brand,” which can confuse your audience. Center your brand around who you truly are and portray an image that is the real you. The easiest way to do this is to not overthink! Post what feels natural to you and aligns with your interests, without thinking too hard about appearing a certain way.

#### Resources:

Your personal statement often captures only a part of the story behind your brand which is why another important element of your portfolio website will be your About Me page. After all, your brand is about you. For inspiration, explore a few examples of About Me pages from the portfolios of UX designers at Google provided below:

- https://www.anqiwan.com/resume
- https://danegalbraith.com/about
- https://www.shabnamkashani.com/kashani-about

> ### **Assignment:**
>
> Draft your About Me page for your web portfolio on a new blank document. 
>
> When writing your About Me page:
>
> - Consider your audience: What do you think your potential employers and recruiters want to know about you?
> - What are you hoping for them to learn about you?
>
> Here are some things you might include:
>
> - What kind of work do you do?
> - What you’re passionate about, or things you value
> - What kind of work culture are you seeking?
> - Where you work currently, and if your job is in a related field
> - What types of teams have you worked on in the past? (remote, in-person, freelance)
> - Your credentials, like this certificate and any additional education
> - Any notable projects, clients, or awards
> - Your contact information, including your email address, links to your profiles on professional networking sites
> - A picture or two of yourself that captures and communicates your personal brand
>
> As you go through this program you'll be developing projects that you can include in your portfolio. Throughout your portfolio, let your designs tell the story and provide evidence of your talent.
>
> ## Choosing fonts and a color scheme
>
> For those creatives out there, choosing what fonts to use and determining a color scheme can be an especially fun part of the portfolio design process! Fonts and colors affect the look and feel of your portfolio website and have a strong influence on your user’s experience. 
>
> Here are some guidelines to follow:
>
> - Choose fonts and colors that are aligned with your personal brand. 
> - Stick with no more than two fonts.
> - Select a small set of colors. To start, choose one or two primary colors and a couple of accent colors. 
>
> Make sure you apply the same color scheme and fonts to all of your online profiles and your resume in addition to your portfolio.

### Activity: Create or Update LinkedIn Profile

![image-20210628205604095](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210628205604095.png)

![image-20210628205647325](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210628205647325.png)

#### [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aOEVfmNi_o-N-fWpG6TPLQnGHCSD2Qf0Er2W_o1yw2w/edit)

> Find inspiration in how other UX Designers set up their own LinkedIn profiles. You can start by going to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2F&trk=login_reg_redirect) and typing “UX Designer” into the search bar. You can also check out some of these Google UX designers' profiles:
>
> - [Shabnam Kashani's profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shabnamkashani/)
> - [Nicolas Pellegrino's profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-pellegrino-20b74914a/)
> - [Tongfang Sun's profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tongfang-sun-a7b6b394/)
> - [Maggie Banks' profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggie-banks-design/)
> - [Kartik Rao's profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karttikrao/)
>
> Select three profiles, then use them to fill out the template.

#### Best Practices

#### 1. Add a headshot

Your headshot should:

- Be a high-resolution photo
- Be shot in portrait orientation, rather than landscape orientation
- Have a non-distracting background
- Be framed from the chest-up 
- Be well-lit 
- Feature you positioned directly at the camera, with your face as the photo’s focus 

##### **Write a clear and concise headline**

Your LinkedIn headline is the first thing that appears under your name and photo on your profile. It should be a clear and concise description of who you are and your skillset in UX. If you are just starting out as a student in UX or are making a career transition, you can start your headline with “UX designer in training” and follow it up with the expertise you’d like to highlight. For example, it’s a good idea to use keywords that show your creativity and organizational skills. 

##### **Fill out your job history**

After you’ve selected a good headshot and given your profile a headline, you’ll fill out your [About section](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/linkedin-summary-examples/). This is where you list your job history or other professional experiences, along with descriptions of your role at each organization. Until you’re further along in your UX design career, it’s okay to simply list the places you’ve worked at and your job title. When you’re ready to start the job search, you can fill in more details about your work experience. 

#### 2. Start building your online presence on LinkedIn

##### **Make connections with people you know**

Start your LinkedIn journey by connecting with people you actually know, especially people you’ve worked with.

##### **Template for connecting with someone you know on LinkedIn**

> *Hi [connection’s name],* 
>
> *It’s good to see you on LinkedIn. [It’s a good idea to then explain your relationship to the person here—whether you went to middle school together, are part of the same religious community, or know each other in another way.]*
>
> *I’m starting my career as a UX designer, and I really like your company’s work. [It’s a good idea to reference specific projects the company’s done that you like, and why.]*
>
> *I want to learn more about your role at [company name], and I was wondering if I could talk with you at some point?*
>
> *Sincerely,*
>
> *[Your Name]*

##### **Make connections with people you want to work with**

A good way to reach out to those people is to browse the LinkedIn profiles of people associated with the company. Check out if you know anyone who currently works at the company or has worked there in the past. If so, don’t be afraid to send them a personalized message to create a point of contact.

If you don’t have connections to anyone at the company, that’s okay too. Send a personalized message to someone at the company whose work impresses you. You can ask if they’d be willing to have a 15-minute conversation about the day-to-day tasks at their job and how they like working at the company. 

##### **Template for connecting with someone you don’t know on LinkedIn**

> *Hi [connection’s name],*
>
> *My name is [your name.] I’m a UX designer in training, and I really like your company’s work. [It’s a good idea to reference specific projects the company’s done that you like, and why.]*
>
> *I want to learn more about your role at [company name], and I was wondering if I could talk with you at some point?*
>
> *Sincerely,*
>
> *[Your Name]*

#### 3. **Take advantage of LinkedIn’s networking features** 

One of LinkedIn’s best features is that it will also tell you if you have friends of friends who work at companies.
You can also join a [LinkedIn Group](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164/linkedin-groups-membership-overview?lang=en). These are groups of people in a particular industry, or who share a specific interest. There are dozens of groups already dedicated to UX design, so join one or two that interest you. Get involved in the group conversation, then feel free to connect with folks in the group and start networking.

#### 4. **Use LinkedIn’s newsfeed to keep up-to-date with professional news**

LinkedIn also lets you follow specific companies and hashtags. Follow hashtags like “#uxdesign,” or “#ux” to learn new trends, read articles, and chat with people who share your interests.

#### 5. **Connect your LinkedIn profile to your website**

Because your LinkedIn is effectively your digital resume, it’s important that people are able to find it from your portfolio website. Add a LinkedIn link or icon on your portfolio homepage. 

### Get involved in UX Design Communities

- Dribbble
- Behance
- Medium
  - UXdesign.cc

### Activity: Create or update a Behance profile

![image-20210628210805072](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210628210805072.png)

- [Behance Website](https://www.behance.net)
- [Google Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/105155345/Google-Safety-Booth?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cgoogle)
- [Lisa Fitcher's Behance](https://www.behance.net/lisasuefischer), UX Designer @Google 

#### **Template for reaching out to someone you know on Behance**

If you’re sending a Behance message to someone you know, remind them of how you know them and explain why you’re reaching out. A good template for reaching out to someone you know is:

> *Hi [connection’s name],* 
>
> *It’s nice to connect with you on Behance. [It’s a good idea to then explain your relationship to the person here—whether you went to middle school together, are part of the same religious community, or know each other in another way.]*
>
>  *I’m starting a career as a UX designer, and I really like your work. [It’s a good idea to reference specific projects they've done that you like, and why.]* 
>
> *I want to learn more about your role at [company name], and I was wondering if I could discuss with you at some point?* 
>
> *Sincerely,**
>
> **[Your Name]*

#### **Template for reaching out to someone you don't know on Behance**

When you send a Behance message to a person you don’t know, it’s important to be polite, honest, and direct with them. Let’s say you’re a UX designer reaching out to an employee of a company you want to work at. A good template for reaching out to someone you don’t know is:

> *Hi [connection’s name],* 
>
> *My name is [your name.] I’ve just started my career as a UX designer, and I really like your company’s work. [It’s a good idea to reference specific projects the company’s done that you like, and why.]* 
>
> *I want to learn more about your role at [company name], and I was wondering if I could discuss with you at some point?* 
>
> *Sincerely,**
>
> **[Your Name]*

#### **Introduction Assessment**

- David included what he does, (UX design) and established his personal brand (that he specializes in Usability and works in a museum). 
- He also mentions readers can learn more about how his museum job informs his UX background in his hyperlinked “About Me” section. 
- He added a point of contact.
- The revised Introduction shines a spotlight on the most important aspects of David’s professional experience.
- The revised version contains keywords like “UX designer” and “Usability.”
- David made sure the revised version was free of misspellings and grammatical errors, like the misspelled name “Renior” (“Renoir”). 

#### About me Assessment

- David’s revised story had a beginning, in which he informed readers of his job; a middle, in which he described how he started thinking like a UX designer; and an end, in which we drew a clear line from that job to his new UX design career.
- The revised section referenced the Usability projects he wants hiring managers to look at, and provides a hyperlink to them. 
- Keywords such as “UX Design” and the descriptor terms “physical” and “virtual” were added into the revised version. 
- The revised section established David as a certified UX Designer and allowed potential employers and recruiters to more easily connect with David’s unique career path.

#### Ask yourself

1. Did you use as few words as possible?
2. Did you avoid complicated language?
3. Did you avoid jargon?
4. Did you include keywords?
5. Did you inject personality?
6. Did you edit carefully?
7. Did you read your writing out loud?
8. Did you structure the information clearly and concisely, highlighting the most important part of the author's story?

## Part 5 - Network and find a mentor

### Develop an UX Design Network

A **mentor** is someone in your field who gives you advice about your career. A mentor is often someone who has many years of experience in their field, so they’re a great source of information for a less-experienced designer.

#### Where to meet professionals

##### Online

To network with professionals, you need to know where to look. Social media is a great place to start.

##### In Person

There are lots of opportunities to network in-person. 

- Networking events are a great way to meet new people in your industry since everybody’s there with the same goal - to network! 
- Lectures or seminars are great networking opportunities because there’s usually time provided to chat with other attendees. 
- Get to know peers in UX design classes, like this certificate program! You can meet your fellow classmates through the discussion forum. 
- Join a UX-focused meet up, like [these](https://www.interaction-design.org/events/ux-meetups) virtual and in-person events set up through the Interaction Design Foundation, that are free to attend and open to everyone. 

Any opportunity you have to meet new people is a chance to network. You never know, the person standing in line with you could be a senior UX designer with a job opportunity!

#### How to reach out

UX designers are more likely to respond to your message when they see that you’re a real human who’s interested in UX design. Having a fleshed-out profile, complete with a link to your portfolio, gives them a good idea of who you are.

![A sparkling trophy graphic, underneath text that reads "fill out and update your profile"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/zSNQvczcQzSjUL3M3PM0uQ_e800c297432142bd8ddb05084f0f74fc_UX_C1_M4_L6_R1_A.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=H-tN_NW5HaaZiqK0HOAaIPb45I9jLbZgpkNLSNsd8nU)

You’re looking to make a personal connection. Write a sentence or two about yourself and try to add something that the other person can connect with. Let them know that you’re new to UX design and looking to learn from a more experienced designer.

![Shaking hands graphic, underneath it says "introduce yourself with a personalized message"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/g8h1sQbgSRWIdbEG4OkVeA_b208821a5a4f44099ca50480991916f2_UX_C1_M4_L6_R1_B.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=omMoAMwPhX4x2tpABcgRSYhNN29XEbWuFIhzrqUvY-E)

Most people are less likely to read a very long email or message from a stranger. Keep your message concise and to the point.

![A graphic of an email draft, underneath it says "Keep it short"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/XvUa-iTsQfa1Gvok7DH22A_b4f30b43a1c2416a84975f83ea4384e3_UX_C1_M4_L6_R1_C.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=YugypODZ8ptJEn0gHsrbZ-Ih4IzaJa5iIy5LYlNyvwI)

Don’t expect to get a job from networking right away. Instead, focus on creating genuine connections with UX designers to help you learn more about the field. Getting a job referral from someone may come later in the relationship.

![a graphic of two silhouettes connected by curved lines, underneath it says "don't ask for a job"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/9XZENRusRsi2RDUbrPbIPQ_d2adfaf2e465407aa974681736ecf337_UX_C1_M4_L6_R1_D.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=gMWupZgeMWHwiMprlt5NlgBgrzn7BC8qXQZf0Z9rYBo)

While you shouldn't ask someone for a job right away, you can be clear about what you want out of the relationship. If you want to know more about a position at their company, what it’s like to be an interaction designer, or tips to improve your portfolio, say that! 

![A graphic of a telescope, underneath it says "be clear about what you want"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qClPgSawS76pT4EmsKu-Mg_9a2f98c2c7434e5cba9a3282275911a1_UX_C1_M4_L6_R1_E.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=Z9Pd5W9w4VcpRD43BtFr0g8Wj8T_0yw7cfMof6LA8qk)

You should always thank the person for taking the time to read your message.

![a graphic of a letter in an envelope, underneath it says "Say thank you"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/j7zQO7KaRJe80DuympSX6g_14f26e1e7bbb4681b71c02566da0b856_UX_C1_M4_L6_R1_F.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=73Bz_Z5lq4MVUg8h1IRHxotfT2b0IhelKrzRAo3vTb4)

If you want to learn more, check out these [10 templates for LinkedIn messages](https://www.themuse.com/advice/want-people-to-accept-your-linkedin-requests-use-these-10-templates), which you can tailor to fit your own personal story. These cover almost all of the scenarios where you might want to reach out to someone for the first time. 

### Overcome Imposter Syndrome

**Impostor syndrome** is the belief that you’re unskilled, inferior to others, or bad at your job, despite your successes. We’ve all felt impostor syndrome at some point in our lives. If you’re feeling impostor syndrome, you’re certainly not alone!

![Graphic that shows how your assumptions about what you know vs. what you think others know vs. the reality](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GqU0YRKfSN-lNGESn_jfew_d2b97dde4dc54c98b5f575cf7374baec_UX_C1_M4_L6_R2_A.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=_7SgJ1hhd0n0QLVSCpDmxxGwpW3iIUe4bW9iIkybwg0)

#### Effects on Imposter Syndrome

Impostor syndrome can cause anxiety and low confidence that can stop you from becoming the most successful version of yourself. Impostor syndrome can manifest in many ways, and each person’s experience is unique. You might have seen or personally experienced impostor syndrome in situations like: 

- Not applying to jobs unless you meet every requirement (even though you totally don’t have to!).
- Taking on extra work to make sure you’re “doing it all” and to look more capable in front of your peers.
- Not attending networking events or career fairs because you’re nervous or anxious.
- Downplaying your abilities during conversations.
- Shrugging off compliments because you don’t believe them.

#### Manage Imposter Syndrome

We want you to meet new people with confidence and without letting impostor syndrome get in the way.

![img](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/VJWHCitwQVyVhworcBFcXg_049a50b1349f4c169639e8d106e393f1_Screen-Shot-2021-06-18-at-2.08.51-PM.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=u3qcFkeB5k5OAmPxcL9-JWBS2MKed0XkWfxZW2_HM1Q)

- **Acknowledge your thoughts.** Recognize how you’re feeling, and try to pinpoint why you’re feeling that way. This will help you figure out what triggers your impostor syndrome, so that you can better manage it in the future.
- **Own your accomplishments.** You have your own unique perspectives and experiences. Think of all of the accomplishments and skills that make you different from the next person. Write them down in a list so that you can see just how much you have to talk about when you network. You have plenty to offer, so go into conversations with confidence!
- **Be honest with yourself.** Do a realistic evaluation of your strengths and weaknesses. Finding areas that create the feeling of not “being good enough” and working to improve them will help you feel more confident in yourself. *Everyone* has areas where they can improve, and there’s always more to learn, so don’t let your weaknesses hold you back.
- **Have a conversation.** Ask a trusted mentor, friend, or seasoned professional how they handle impostor syndrome.
- **Wear something that makes you feel confident.** Looking good helps you feel good. If you’re going to an in-person networking event, put on your favorite professional attire so that you feel like the best version of yourself.
- **Help someone else.** Sharing the knowledge that you have with others helps you feel more valuable. This could be giving advice to someone less experienced than you or sharing a unique experience with one of your peers. If you think you don’t have anything to offer anyone else, refer back to the list you made earlier.
- **Fake it till you make it.** Even if you don’t feel confident in your abilities as a designer, if you *act* confident for long enough, eventually it will become second nature to you. People are naturally drawn to confident individuals, so acting confidently will likely help you make even more connections within your workplace and the UX community. 
- **Go with a friend.** Attending networking events with someone you know can help you feel less overwhelmed and nervous.
- **Get to know people.** Becoming more familiar with other UX professionals will make you feel less out of place. You’ll come to realize that experienced UX designers aren’t as intimidating as they may initially seem! This will help you feel less nervous in the future when you meet other people. 
- **Know that you're not alone.** If you’re going to a networking event, or you’re starting a group project with people you don’t know, you won’t be the only one who feels they don’t belong. Being around experienced professionals can be intimidating, even if you’re one yourself! Plus, even the most experienced UX designers were once in your shoes. We all started somewhere. 

## Activity: Practice Networking

![image-20210628222749510](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210628222749510.png)

## **Reach out to colleagues and friends**

A good place to start establishing your network is to pull from the connections you already have. It’s very possible that someone who is already in your network could offer some valuable advice or even help connect you to other professions within the industry. 

## Step 1: Create a list of potential connections

Determine who you can contact for advice in your career journey.

Some people who you may want to include:

- Past teachers or counselors 
- Previous employers and coworkers 
- Relatives and friends 

These people will serve as a starting point for establishing career-centered contacts who can help you navigate the industry and, when you’re ready, the job market. You never know who may have a connection that could be of value to you, so think broadly.

## Step 2: Make initial contact

You can network with these connections either in person or online through platforms such as LinkedIn or Behance. 

- Say hello and reintroduce yourself if it’s been awhile
- When networking online, send a message on a networking platform or by email 
- Save time by drafting a general inquiry message you can tailor to each individual person

## Step 3: Share your career goals

Once you make initial contact, tell them about your career goals and what you’ve been working on so far. Provide context to your situation to help guide the conversation towards:

- General career advice
- Introduction to one of their contacts who is familiar with your field 

## Step 4: Follow up

Once you have connected with someone, keep track of the last time you spoke with them, and make sure to follow up every couple of months. And don’t forget to always thank them for their time and support!

- Keep a conversation going so when they come across an opportunity you might be interested in, they think of you.

### **Best practices**

When contacting individuals who you may know already, stick to these guiding principles:

- **Do your homework.** Go into your discussion with an understanding of the person’s job history, where they currently work, the position they hold, and what their organization does. 
- **Ask open-ended questions.** When it comes to making a professional connection, it is important to let the person with more experience and industry knowledge talk. Take this as an opportunity to learn about their experiences and ask if they have any advice for you. 
- **Offer assistance.** While we recommend that you don’t outright ask for a job, you could consider offering to assist them as well, such as a freelance opportunity or helping them with a small project. 

## **Set up informational interviews**

Whether you have a professional mentor or you are just starting to build a network of UX Design connections, it is important to actively seek out knowledgeable professionals and gather information. Your goal is to gain more insight into the UX Design field. Conducting an informational interview is a great way to build your network and gain further insight into the field. The following steps are recommended:

## Step 1: Set a date, time, and meeting location

After making initial contact with someone within your network with knowledge about UX Design, set a date and time to meet with them to discuss career options and goals. Let them know that you are available to meet in person or virtually at their convenience. Keep in mind that for meetups like this, a virtual meeting can often be the easiest for both you and your contact. 

## Step 2: Prepare questions and points for discussion

Go into the interview prepared by writing out questions you want to ask and other points you would like to discuss. This will allow the conversation to flow easier and will help you feel more prepared going into the interview. Some topics to bring up might include:

1. Advice on how to find your first UX design job
2. How to develop specific skills or learn a new tool
3. Feedback on specializing in a type of design or being a generalist designer

## Step 3: Set expectations

Once the interview is wrapping up, make sure you express your interest to stay in touch. If they are willing, set up a time to meet regularly, like once a month, to fill them in on your progress and revisit your goals.

## Step 4: Follow up

After the interview is complete, send them a thank you message either by mail or electronically. The goal of the meeting was for you to gather information, and chances are they gave you plenty of advice to think about. Tell them how valuable the discussion was to you and remind them of your interest to stay in touch. 

### **Best practices**

- **Have clear goals in mind.** Go into the interview with a sense of what you want to get out of it. You want to gather information, but determine what you need clarity on.
- **Ask for feedback.** Consider sharing your portfolio and asking your mentor or interviewee to give you feedback. Be clear about the kind of feedback you need and what your goals are. Sharing work with others regularly can help you focus on what you need to improve on, as well as help you recognize your strengths.

## **Keep track of your network**

Although it’s not necessary, if you’re working hard to build your network and make new connections, it can be really helpful to have a way to keep track of all the people you are meeting. We suggest using a spreadsheet to keep track of your contacts.

## Part 1 - Introduction to Course 2

### Introduction to the portfolio project

As you complete courses in this certificate program, you will create projects for your portfolio to show off your work to potential employers. It’s a very exciting time because you’re about to begin your first design project! 

![icons of a mockup of an app, with burgers and fries as menu items. Beneath, words say "Portfolio Project 1"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/L4qLwHkPTSyKi8B5D90s6w_e38bb9bd8300441b83e3fe4dde68e7cf_Screenshot-2021-03-03-at-1.00.11-PM.png?expiry=1625011200000&hmac=gZfqdz8NRQwJj5u00SLPbRsX7e7Ew0m-FNqjZgH5LgQ)

#### Choose a prompt using Sharpen

To help narrow the scope, your first project will focus on **designing a mobile app** to meet the specific need of a hypothetical business or organization. You’ll choose a prompt that will give you more specific guidelines. For example, your project prompt might be to design a mobile app for the checkout process at your favorite hometown restaurant. Or, the prompt might be to design an app for a rapper’s album pre-order. There are tens of thousands of project prompts you’ll be able to choose from — the choice is yours! 

> You’ll find all of these project prompts from Sharpen, an online tool that creates randomized design prompts, in the next activity. Use [Sharpen](https://sharpen.design/) to generate a UX Design Certificate

## Part 2 - Understand the role of research in design

### Introduction to UX Research

UX Research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback.
Product development life cycle is the process to take a product from an idea to a reality

> UX research is a continuous part of the product development life cycle and takes place [ _ _ _ ] Phase 3: Design. 
>
> 1. before, (Foundational / Strategic / Generative Research) 
> 2. during, (Design / Tactical Research) 
> 3. after (Post-Launch Research) 

#### UX Research Qualities:

1. Empathy
   able to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation
2. Pragmatism
   focused on reaching goals
3. Collaboration
   can work with a range of people, personalities, and work styles

### Learn more about UX Research

UX design is all about putting the user first, and research helps designers understand those users. 

**UX research** focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback. Your product design should be built upon research and facts, not assumptions. UX research aligns what you, as the designer, *think* the user needs with what the user *actually* needs. 

Product Development Life Cycle has 5 stages and the figure below shows how research fits into the product development life cycle.
![Graphic showing the product development lifecycle, represented by a circle](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/aBU8zfg4TCOVPM34OFwjnw_90904f27872d491c81158d83f66e8a4d_Screenshot-2021-03-03-at-1.14.48-PM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=icsdE6epa-OC7A4urqL57ytksF-_rNwSzEKTvQGtKrI)

#### 1. Foundational Research

**Foundational research** is always done *before* you start designing. Within the product development life cycle, foundational research happens during the brainstorm stage (stage one) to help you empathize with users, understand their needs, and inspire new design directions. During this stage, you will also make personas and user stories

> In foundational research, your goal is to figure out what the user needs and how to address those needs with your product. Strong foundational research can contradict your personal perspective on what a good solution might be. 
>
> Questions you might consider during foundational research include:
>
> - What should we build?
> - What are the user’s problems?
> - How can we solve those problems?
> - Am I aware of my own biases, and am I able to filter them as I do research?

Common foundational research methods include: 

- **Interviews:** A research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. You’ll often conduct interviews of your target users themselves.
- **Surveys:** An activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product.
- **Focus groups:** A small group of people whose reactions are studied. For example, your focus group might bring together eight users to discuss their perspectives about new features in your design. A focus group is usually run by a moderator who guides the group on a certain topic of conversation. 
- **Competitive audit:** An overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. You'll conduct your own competitive audit later in the course, so you will understand this research method well! 
- **Field studies:** Research activities that take place in the user's context or personal environment, rather than in an office or lab. 
- **Diary studies:** A research method used to collect qualitative data about user behaviors, activities, and experiences over time. Often, a user will log, or diary, about their daily activities and provide information about their behaviors and needs, which can help inform your designs. 

#### 2. Design Research

**Design research** is done *while* you design. Within the product development lifecycle, design research happens during the design stage (stage three) to help inform your designs, to fit the needs of users, and to reduce risk. Each time you create a new version of your design, new research should be done to evaluate what works well and what needs to be changed. 

![icon of a profile of a head with tools and icons coming out of the top; text reads: design research](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/5AkUuwpGQTaJFLsKRuE2uA_8a46fd7110f249969431abb764570737_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.21.34-AM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=1r09J2zJ6EnJum99BnL_QBcseIPhpsPCSlg_y_aNV9g)

> In design research, your goal is to answer the question: 
>
> - How should we build it?
>
> The amount of design research you conduct will vary depending on where you work and what you’re building

Research methods that might be used to conduct design research include:

- **Usability Study**, which is a technique to evaluate a product by testing it on users. The goal of usability studies is to identify pain points that the user experiences with your prototypes, so the issues can be fixed before the product launches.
- **A/B testing**: A research method that evaluates and compares two different aspects of a product to discover which of them is most effective. For example, you might have users evaluate two layouts for the homepage of your app to find out which layout is more effective. 
- **Cafe or guerrilla studies:** A research method where user feedback is gathered by taking a design or prototype into the public domain and asking passersby for their thoughts. For example, you might sit in a local coffee shop and ask customers if they would be willing to test your app design for a couple of minutes and provide feedback. 
- **Card sorting:** A research method that instructs study participants to sort individual labels written on notecards into categories that make sense to them. This type of research is largely used to figure out the information architecture of your project, which we’ll discuss in the next course of the program — Course 3: Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Designs.
- **Intercepts:** A research method that gathers on-site feedback from users as they engage in the activities being researched. Intercepts are often conducted in the field, so this type of research is often considered a subset of field research. An intercept study can provide quick, high-level feedback.

#### 3. Post-launch Research

**Post-launch research** is done *after* the design is complete and your product has launched. Within the product development life cycle, post-launch research happens after the launch stage (stage five) to help validate that the product is meeting user needs through established metrics.

![icon of a rocket ship in front of a laptop screen; text reads: post-launch research](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/AKOy2owtT-CjstqMLZ_gcA_b96ebe081b454789ba1ad41cb062cf27_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.21.43-AM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=wCEwbzc_C8yZ_QCUTOH1HByuYfooiCAZNl5GTUODO6c)

> Your goal is to answer the question: 
>
> - Did we succeed? 
>
> This research will tell you how your final product is performing based on established metrics, such as adoption, usage, user satisfaction, and more. 

Research methods you might use to conduct post-launch research include:

- **A/B testing**
- **Usability studies**
- **Surveys**
- **Logs analysis:** A research method used to evaluate recordings of users while they interact with your design, tools, etc. 

> The key to a user-focused product: **Research**
>
> Research is crucial to creating a product that satisfies users. As an entry-level designer, it might be tempting to assume what the user needs based on your own experience, but as you know: The user comes first. Always make sure that your opinions are backed up by your research. You should get feedback from your users before, during, and after you design!

## Part 3 - Explore UX Research Methods

### Choose the right research methods

Methods is how you get your research done

#### There are two ways to conduct a research:

1. Who conducts the research,

   ![Definitions of primary and secondary research](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/UH9-FF7jR8K_fhRe4wfCxA_f975731d5ce64cccbe9b83ab6b583e11_Screenshot-2021-03-03-at-1.45.32-PM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=FvkPNuOQIQAmpM5pOAr9wA-U5fR2RI2CskfW2kbMYz0)

   - Primary Research, research that you conduct yourself
     Example: Interview, Surveys, or Usability Study
   - Secondary Research (usually Product Leads are doing it), uses information someone else put together
     Example: Books, Articles, or Journals

2. The type of data collected,

   ![definitions of qualitative and quantitative research](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/f3FbAG_fTgWxWwBv3z4F7g_3c7d77b4d1dd43ff89c51d7bb148b0f4_Screenshot-2021-03-03-at-1.45.07-PM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=i7FVyHchNPJJm1jVUgm_j-0CmgcAovHc9VOGbzuTcC8)

   - Quantitative Research *"what"*, 
     is often based on surveys of large groups of people using numerical answers
   - Qualitative Research *"why"*, 
     focuses on observation

#### Common Research Methods:

- Interviews 
  research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings.
- Surveys
  an activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product
- Usability Studies
  evaluate a product by testing it on users. The goal of a usability study is to identify pain points that the user experiences with different prototypes, so the issues can be fixed before the final product launches

> If the product has already launched, a post-launch usability study might include data like success metrics and key performance indicators, which are commonly known as KPIs. 
>
> Key performance indicators are critical measures of progress toward an end goal. The KPIs for an app or new product launch might include things like how much time the user spent on a task or the number of clicks they used to make a purchase. 

### Understand benefits and drawbacks of Research Methods

## Part 4 - Identify biases in UX Research

### Identify types of bias in UX Research

> Bias is favoring or having prejudice against something based on limited information

#### Kind of Biases

1. Confirmation Bias
   occurs when you start looking for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have. Overcoming: 
   - ask open- ended questions
   - actively listen
   - include a large sample of users
2. False consensus Bias
   overestimate the number of people will agree with our idea or design. Overcoming:
   - identify and articulate your own assumptions
   - survey large groups of people
3. Primacy Bias
   remember the first participant most strongly. Overcoming:
   - take detailed notes / recordings
   - interview each participant in the same way
4. Recency Bias
   it's easiest to remember the last thing you heard. Overcoming:
   - take notes / recordings
   - interview each participant in the same way
5. Implicit Bias
   the collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge. Overcoming:
   - reflect on our own behaviors
   - ask others to point out our implicit biases
6. Sunk Cost Fallacy
   the deeper we get into a project we've invested in, the harder it is to change course. Overcoming:
   - break down your project into smaller phases
   - outline points where you can decide whether to continue or stop

### Learn more about bias in UX Research

##### Preventing bias in data collection

> It’s important to note that everyone has biases. It’s just a natural part of being human. Being able to recognize your own biases and prevent them from affecting your work is what really matters. As a UX designer, you’ll need to know how to anticipate, identify, and overcome biases in your research, in particular.

#### 1. Choose your words carefully

While conducting research, it’s important to use words that don’t lead the user in one direction or another.
Choosing leading words can cause the **framing effect**, where users make a decision or choice based on the way information was presented to them. This is especially critical in Usability Studies, to improve your product, you need *honest* feedback.

![icon of a hand, finger pressing a button; text reads: choose your words carefully](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/VuR1MH4fQvakdTB-H6L2Yw_c6a0d099db354167bce5ecbdf133dddf_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.48.32-AM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=1cPlxBf449D3nPMMk2InBK3t0A9WFkRiRZnd3OsCRXQ)

#### 2. Foster Independent Thinking

**Foster independent thinking**. Group interviews can be affected by the **bandwagon effect**, or going along with the group’s opinion instead of thinking creatively, which can discourage open discussion by people who have an opinion that doesn’t align with the majority of the group. 

![icon of 3 paper airplanes; text reads: foster independent thinking](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/i0AUGVD2SqeAFBlQ9nqnuw_dd96a9d18d984b68a27b3aa84e2d0ec1_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.48.44-AM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=6fqTeHnf9Q83K7MVcY9U-UYqsIE7S-EXYS7yH0pi0fI)

To combat the bandwagon effect, ask participants to write down or record their thoughts before discussing as a group.

#### 3. Avoid Specific Language

**Avoid specific language**. It’s important to be mindful about the types of questions you ask users and how those questions are framed. You’ll need to be careful to avoid **confirmation bias,** which is trying to find evidence to prove a hypothesis you already have. Confirmation bias is particularly prevalent in online surveys.

![Icon of a magnifying glass magnifying a paper; text reads: avoid specific language](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/pXLyH8wFRcSy8h_MBSXEPQ_19da55c5d79641a28ad9c461210a9cb0_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.48.57-AM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=3wvbLv7O2hKo2uqMj5VNlL7Rqp5ZK9b1YwjGE3feJgI)

Remember, in a survey, you want measurable results, which is known as quantitative data. You can reframe the question in your survey to ask participants to rate their experiences using the product, which will be a more accurate way to gauge how they felt about using it.

#### 4. Limit the guidance you give users

**Limit the guidance you give users**. Everyone learns and thinks in different ways. When you’re conducting any type of UX research, you have to be cautious to avoid experiencing any **false consensus**, which is the assumption that others will think the same way as you do. If you’re conducting a usability study, some of the participants will not follow the product’s user flow in the way that you might expect. 

![icon of a funnel; text reads: limit the guidance you give users.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/XXR75_SxRNu0e-f0sQTb6g_f7156520c6fe49b09d0fc678cf1713c8_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.50.36-AM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=tBdzfk8S_BeHqOFpqHhdAzLZ4bEb-XQ2ddIyWhy2TFY)

It’s important to let participants follow their own paths through your product, without interrupting them. Interrupting a participant while they’re experiencing your product will deprive you of useful data that can help you understand how to improve your designs. Instead, ask participants to narrate or break down their user journey with your product, as they move through the flow. This will allow you to better understand their thought process as they navigate through your designs. 

#### 5. Consider users' tone and body language

**Consider users’ tone and body language**. To avoid experiencing **implicit biases**, which are based on the collection of attitudes and stereotypes you associate with people without your conscious knowledge**,** it’s important to clarify when you think you’re getting mixed signals from a participant. 

![icon of a facial profile, with sound coming out of mouth; text reads: consider users' tone and body language](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/y5TZ0iEtSyyU2dIhLbssSQ_7fb9097bce93433581df810f335f64e8_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.50.47-AM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=tPc1DSeLY6Zp8zGbcW-yN_2vKsfolwEAhIG_ZqQDfoM)

For this feedback process to work, however, it’s important to make sure participants are comfortable sharing their thoughts with you. Before the research begins, ask participants about themselves or make light conversation. Starting with easier questions can help reduce anxiety or awkwardness throughout the study. 

#### 6. Be careful of your own body language and restrictions

**Be careful of your own body language and reactions**. You also have to be mindful of your *own* tone and body language while interacting with participants. **Social desirability bias** can happen when a participant answers a question based on what they *think* you want to hear. If you ask a question to a participant, and they notice you exhibiting a visual or audible clue that suggests your own opinion about the question, they might answer in a way that they think will please you. 

![Icon of a person shrugging; text reads: be careful of your own body language and reactions](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/l5yTU9cvR9eck1PXL8fXlw_8b1fc2eaffad426fa92c428455e22458_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.50.56-AM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=D8r2k0hUgHKrQR3D_Po0iBsK5_gE_fy8oJFU_hjXFxs)

If you want the data you collect to be useful, the user has to feel comfortable sharing their true, unfiltered feelings about the product. It’s your job to guide them through the process without accidentally influencing their answers. One way to do this is to reassure participants that their answers won’t hurt anyone’s feelings and that you really want to hear their honest opinions in order to improve your work. 

#### 7. Plan your research effectively

**Plan your research effectively**. Tight deadlines are inevitable. But as a UX designer, it’s essential you get enough time to recruit the right users for your research. **Availability bias** occurs when you rush the user recruitment process or skip screener questions to attract a bigger pool of users, even if they don’t fit the qualifications or characteristics that you’ve already determined are present in your ideal user. 

![icon of a magnifying glass with a check mark in it; text reads: plan your research effectively](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Fc4RaC2uTYOOEWgtrt2D0w_2aab4ecec29d44e29035cc60f7702639_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.54.25-AM.png?expiry=1625097600000&hmac=wsGfAIgYq4HagtUOPjRDhSLp1gXI8TVMGlPvD5bJxrw)

The research that you collect is vital to your product design process. So interviewing users that don’t fall under your personas won’t give you the data you need to improve your designs. If you’re having trouble recruiting the right users before your deadline, offer a better incentive for participating in your study, adjust your recruitment strategy, or ask your project manager for more time. Don’t just take any user who’s available. 

#### 8. Remain open minded

**Remain open minded**. One more tip: When you’re conducting research, you have to work hard to treat all information equally to avoid both **primacy bias,** which is remembering the first user more than others, and **recency bias**, which is most easily remembering the last thing you heard.

To help combat these biases in your own research, it’s helpful to space out the scheduling of interviews, ask your colleagues to join you during interviews to provide additional opinions, and take careful notes.

# Week 2 - Empathizing with users and defining pain points

## Part 1 - Build an empathy map 

### Empathize with users

Empathy, the ability to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation

> UX Design is not about solving problems we assume users want solved. It's about solving problems that users actually want solved

### Understand empathy in UX Design

##### How to empathize with users

Here are six tips that can help you become a more empathetic UX designer.

#### 1. Ask lots of questions

![Icon of question marks, next to heading: Ask lots of questions](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/8NSQgqK6Rf2UkIKiunX9rg_59f39305dcf04621ae21bb5eaa976c2e_Screenshot-2021-03-03-at-2.20.43-PM.png?expiry=1626220800000&hmac=4rvsFPXoOSyaZ9QSVruZAX_mvUW82T60QAFzo-i1xa8)As a UX designer, you cannot make assumptions about the needs of your users. Instead, ask your users directly about their needs and wants, which your product design can address. Ask questions that begin with what, how, and why to gain a deeper understanding of your users’ perspective.

#### 2. Become more observant

![Icon of a video camera, and a heading that reads "Become more observant"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/2qdxV8h4TTSncVfIeD00nQ_edcb08ad76e5457fadc6f7436dc50422_Screenshot-2021-03-03-at-2.20.56-PM.png?expiry=1626220800000&hmac=g51Lmi9DoW2uLlXcA2w8eSU2AMfRILQ6JE3CLBBp564)Shift your focus to the whole user and not just the words they are using. In interviews where the user is physically present or on a video recording, watching a user interact with you or your product can provide physical cues that can affect your research outcomes. To help capture observations, you’ll take detailed notes or even record your sessions with users.

#### 3. Be an active listener

![Icon of an ear, and a heading that reads "be an active listener"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/zxeiCn12RpuXogp9diabmQ_3d81bce48863400b92f586d4a8d0c732_Screenshot-2021-03-03-at-2.21.11-PM.png?expiry=1626220800000&hmac=6FC9Z2rKTA88qhCxzP6BcYC7rullyEVDlIRM77euQAU)

Active listening requires you to fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being said by the user you’re interacting with. Avoid getting distracted by where the conversation is going or what you might say next. In UX design, practicing active listening can help you get impartial feedback directly from your users, which you can apply to improve your designs.

#### 4. Request Input

![Icon of a person with arrows pointing towards them, and a heading that reads "request input"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/VtR-vASsRTKUfrwErPUyLA_69f54bc7b54f4ed6ba94644032c917a4_Screenshot-2021-03-03-at-2.21.33-PM.png?expiry=1626220800000&hmac=er6_icqtQQGF5R9hd-E8flArocGm54TAFjwQ6NSkNhc)

It’s important that the feedback you receive is objective and unbiased. Friends or colleagues often provide biased, mostly positive feedback because they want to support or please you. So, it’s important to request input from a variety of sources and a diverse group of users. When asking for feedback, use open-ended questions to understand the user’s actual thoughts on the experience or product.

#### 5. Have an open mind

![Icon of a silhouette of a head, opening up to reveal a brain, heading that reads "Have an open mind"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/fctUC5vZTTGLVAub2Q0xHg_bf45e65cda5049599e1fd4cf9d911ea6_Screenshot-2021-03-03-at-2.21.57-PM.png?expiry=1626220800000&hmac=RJW1LQHKXUvirFlVadiZ80bPDniVbgS_OuYOaYflM-A)

We all have biases. Remember, a **bias** is favoring or having prejudice against something or someone, based on limited information. As UX designers, we have to set those biases aside to better empathize with others. Your goal is to understand users, not to complicate their feedback with your own opinions and emotions. 

#### 6. Keep current on UX research

![Icon of a magnifying glass, heading that reads "Keep current on UX research"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/R5mnENtaRSmZpxDbWlUpDA_d2dd1213d2884f6e9c4ee81e3882fd04_Screenshot-2021-03-03-at-2.22.11-PM.png?expiry=1626220800000&hmac=4z_P6GrkFml9CCiDyLtqt-MEYaL5l7fjf1miAHyFNRg)

Follow researchers and join online communities to stay up-to-date on the research that affects UX designers and the users you’re designing for. Research is always changing and evolving as we understand more about human psychology. Staying current will give you an advantage in how you understand and interact with your audience. 

##### Empathy vs Sympathy

To learn more, check out [this video on the power of empathy](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x28nj7a) from Dr. Brené Brown.

![img](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/D1LJ3qCPR7CSyd6gjwewhQ_83a1ddc8398b4ed49f9de1004ed27af1_Hnet-image.gif?expiry=1626220800000&hmac=aQs2VxCeBTFmJQftjvbz3zpRxT7dafecqZ2CrOozUhM)

> Empathy is sometimes confused with sympathy, but the two terms don’t mean the same thing. 
> **Empathy** means understanding someone’s feelings or thoughts, often by feeling the emotions yourself.
> **Sympathy** is the experience of showing concern or compassion without feeling the emotions themselves. 

### Recruit Interview participants

Here are some tips to find and recruit people

#### Determine Interview Goals

You want to ensure that the interviews you conduct are worthwhile, both for you and for the participants. To make the most of your time together, you need to determine clear goals for the interview. Here are some examples of common research goals when it comes to empathizing with users: 

- I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.
- I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address.
- I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I’m designing. 

#### Use a screener to select a representative sample of study participants 

The participants you select for a research study should be based on your research goals and the target users of the product you’re designing. The best way to check if potential participants meet the study’s desired characteristics and represent a diverse set of backgrounds is by sending a screener survey. 

A **screener survey** is a detailed list of questions that help researchers determine if potential participants meet the requirements of the research study. Screening participants often requires collecting **demographics,** which are the characteristics of a group or individual. Demographics that you might ask about in a screener survey include:

- Age
- Geographic location
- Job title or Industry
- Gender

> It’s important to recognize that asking demographic questions can be a sensitive and challenging space to navigate. Be conscious and mindful of the questions you ask in screener surveys and how you ask them. Frame questions in a way that is respectful and inclusive, and make questions optional if they ask about demographic data. 
>
> You might want to preface demographic questions with a short explanation of why the question is being asked. For example, “In the spirit of inclusive design, we are asking these questions to make sure we’re reaching out to a diverse group of people.”
>
> Interviewing participants with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities is extremely important to ensure that your designs are accessible and equitable. A **representative sample** is a small group of participants who represent both the target user group *and* user groups that are often marginalized. Interviewing a representative sample will help you improve the overall user experience of your product because inclusive design benefits everyone. 
>
> Ultimately, the research you conduct should help you create great experiences for all users! 

#### Find Research Participants

Based on these project details, you can choose from a variety of ways to find research participants.

1. **Personal Network**
   Family, friends, or colleagues who fit the demographics of the target users you're designing for
2. **Existing user base**
   If you're conducting research and creating deign for an organization with an existing user base, you'll likely be able to recruit participants from that group of established connections. Recruiting from an existing user base is pretty common in the real world
3. **Online**
   You can use your own social media to find research participants or websites created specifically to connect with research participants like [UserTesting](https://www.usertesting.com/) and [User Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/plp/user-research?utm_campaign=r-nurture-SignupGoal&utm_content=r-nurture-SignupGoal&device=c&campaignid=2069533395&adgroupid=78956501640&utm_term=remote user research&matchtype=b&adposition=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=r-search-paid&gclid=Cj0KCQiAhs79BRD0ARIsAC6XpaXPwRy4R_mrvBrbnYjwHKA6oeP3oRZukFdyqqtDM8FN-jEXe_omJlIaAgR-EALw_wcB) . You can also find online groups that have users with the demographic characteristics you want to interview
4. **Hallway testing**
   If recruiting participants online doesn’t seem like an option, a less formal way to recruit for your study is to ask people in person. Hallway testing, means asking people that pass by in the “hallway” to try the product you’re designing. It's best to position yourself where you'll most likely encounter your product's target audience.
   This is effective when you have limited time and have limited number of participants. However it's very risky due to might not have all the characteristics of your product's potential users
5.  **Third-party recruiting agencies**
   Some organizations have a budget to hire third-party research recruiting agencies. Recruiting agencies are useful because they save you time and can often reach diverse users.  

#### Reach out to participants

Once you’ve identified potential research participants, send an email that introduces the project and yourself as the researcher. If you have the budget to provide an **incentive** to motivate or encourage people to participate in a research study, like a gift card, include that in the email, too. Here's a template

> Hello **[Participant Name]**,
>
> I am currently working on a project for a certificate program where I need to conduct interviews about **[explain the project]**. 
>
> Your participation in the research study would be very valuable to help us **[summary of project goals]**. Details of the study are shared below. 
>
> - Location: **[Address and link to map]**
> - Study dates: **[Date range]**
> - Time: **[Time range]**
> - Session length: **[Estimated length of time for each interview]**
>
> With your permission, we will record each interview to help us decide how to improve our product. Recordings will only be shared with project team members for the scope of this project. A consent form is attached to this email that you need to sign and send back. 
>
> If you have any questions, please contact me through email at **[your email address]**. 
>
> If you are interested in being interviewed, please let me know when you are available between **[date range of study]** and the hours of **[time range of study]**.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> **[Your Name]**

#### Write interview questions

There are a few best practices to keep in mind when writing interview questions:

1. **Ask open-ended questions**
2. **Keep questions short and simple**
3. **Ask follow-up questions**

### Activity: Recruit interview participants for your portfolio project

![image-20210712215802122](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210712215802122.png)

1. Determine interview goals
2. Recruit participants
   In the real world, you would normally interview a group of 8 - 12 participants during the empathize phase, but for this exercise interview 4 - 6 participants. If you dont remember how to, revisit -[ Recruit interview participants](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/supplement/tPei3/recruit-interview-participants) reading. 
3. Schedule interviews
   Write interview questions, draft 4-7 questions for your interview. Be sure to ask the same set of questions to each participant, so you can easily identify themes from participants. If you forget, revisit - Revisit [the Recruit interview participants](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/supplement/tPei3/recruit-interview-participants) reading for guidance on best practices when writing interview questions.

![image-20210712220738956](C:\Users\Felix\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210712220738956.png)

### Conduct user interviews

As a UX designer, you'll always focus on the user and the experience they’ll have with the product you’re designing.
In order to empathize with users and understand their pain points, you'll need to conduct interviews with real people who might use the product you’re designing. 

#### Prepare for the interview

Whether you're conducting interviews in person or online, it’s important to be prepared before you speak with real users.![Prepare for the interview: Interview preparation checklist as the the user researches on the computer](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/N92V3NaTRcmdldzWk3XJ9w_3fd8aafd7ad645d49189c5b6fd9e4be9_Screen-Shot-2021-02-14-at-11.38.18-AM.png?expiry=1626220800000&hmac=ZQd_uB2G7W2ULAvf3m9JxBEEZPfO0Yz9tw8BFVSc-KM)

1. **Script interview questions**
   Develop a list of questions that you’ll ask all of the users you interview. It's considered a best practice to keep interview questions fairly consistent across users, but this list of questions is just a guide. You can deviate from the questions you prepared, if necessary, to learn more about the user and their pain points.
2. **Collect supplies.**
   Create a checklist of items you'll need for the interview, such as a computer, a printed list of questions, or paper and a pencil. If you're using new equipment or technology during the interview, make sure you know how it works in advance.
3. **Research the users.** 
   Take time to learn what you can about the people you’ll interview. If the users you’re preparing to interview provide their personal information before the interview, be sure to take note of it. This information might include their name, demographic information, relevant experience with the product you’re designing, or details about how they learned about the interview.
4. **Practice**
   It’s always a good idea to practice delivering the questions you’ll ask users before you conduct a real interview. This gives you time to make changes to the questions you’re planning to ask and helps ensure that the interviews run smoothly. Practicing is also a good way to determine if the length of the interview is appropriate, or if you need to add or cut questions from your list. You can practice asking interview questions in front of a mirror or with a trusted colleague.

#### Meet the participant

![Meet the partcipant. The user and researcher shake hands as the researcher says, "How has your day been?"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wbkd8eBVRLG5HfHgVQSxng_ceda01f9f4384ea999fc4d86db6a4f82_Screen-Shot-2021-02-14-at-11.52.33-AM.png?expiry=1626220800000&hmac=oALQ4hDm3mlQtP-3pFZvpdNV6sktAbRMKroGKs9j8I4)

1. **Build a rapport**
    Building a good rapport is all about establishing a professional, but friendly, interaction. Making light conversation, like asking how the user's day has been, can help establish a relationship before the interview begins. Simple questions and welcoming gestures can put the user at ease, which will help them share their true feelings once the interview begins. 
2. **Thank users for coming**
   Before the interview begins, show gratitude to the people you’re interviewing for taking the time to meet with you and share their perspectives. Thanking users is a part of establishing a good rapport and can help them feel like their opinions are valued. 
3. **Gather basic details**
   As you meet users, remember to ask about basic information that's relevant to the interview, such as their name or demographic details.
