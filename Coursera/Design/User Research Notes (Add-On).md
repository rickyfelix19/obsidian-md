> #### How to do User Research 
>
> > User Research are split into two Subsets:
> >
> > 1. Qualitative Research:
> >     Ethnographic field studies and interviews are examples of methods that can help you build a deep understanding of **why** users behave the way they do. Qualitative research requires great care. As it involves collecting non-numerical data (e.g. opinions), your own opinions might influence findings.
> > 2. Quantitative Research:
> >    With more-structured methods such as surveys, you gather measurable data about **what** users do and test assumptions you developed from qualitative research. An example is to use an online survey to ask users questions about their shopping habits. You can use this data to find patterns within a large user group.
>
> User Research can also be split into two approaches:
>
> 1. Attitudinal: you listen to user's words (e.g. interviews) 
> 2. Behavioral: you watch their actions through observational studies

> ## Leverage User Research Methods *throughout* Development
>
> According to *Nielsen Norman Group* there are 4 Stages of Appropriate User Research Methods:
>
> 1. Discover - *Determine what's relevant for users*
>    - Diary Studies 
>      Have users log their performance of activities or record their daily interactions with a design.
>    - Contextual Inquiries
>      Interview suitable users in *their own environment* to find out how they perform the task/s in question.
> 2. Explore - *See how to address all users' needs*
>    - Card Sorting
>      On cards, write words and phrases and then let participants organize these in the most meaningful way and label categories to ensure your design is logically structured.
>    - Customer Journey Maps
>      Create user journeys to reveal potential pitfalls and crucial moments.
> 3. Test - *Evaluate your design*
>    - Usability Testing
>      Make sure your design is easy to use.
>    - Accessibility Evaluations
>      Test your design to ensure everyone can use it.
> 4. Listen - *Put issues in perspective, uncover any new problems and spot trends*
>    - Analytics
>      Gather analytics/metrics to chart (e.g.) website traffic and generate reports.
>    - Surveys/ Questionnaires
>      Track how users’ feel about your product/design via these.
>
> ##### Tips:
>
> - However you approach user research, <u>always **consider the pros and cons of each technique**</u>
> - The **resources** available to you are another constraint
> - Carefully choose only the **most relevant method/s for *your* research**. 
> - Get **stakeholders from your organization involved *early on***
> - User research is a valuable way to ***validate* the assumptions the design team makes concerning users in the field**, ***cut* the expense of the best deliverables** and ***keep* your product's demand high** and **ahead of competitors’ in the marketplace.**

> #### User Research: Pain Points
>
> Customer pain points are a specific problem that customers or prospective customers of your business are experiencing in the marketplace. They are essentially any problems that the customer may experience along their customer journey. Getting to the bottom of your customer pain points involves a degree of thinking outside the box and putting yourself in the shoes of your customers.
>
> Here are the list of common pain points:
>
> 1. Productivity Pain Points
>    These customers want to make the most of their time so anything that adds redundancy to the buying process will cause them frustration. When it comes to the products you offer you want to focus on the following characteristics if you want to solve productivity pain points:
>    - Optimizing Productivity
>    - Increase Comfort
>    - Convenience
> 2. Support Pain Points
>    Support pain points are areas where your customers aren’t receiving help during the buying process. 
> 3. Financial Pain Points
>    Financial pain points are areas where prospective customers are spending too much money with their current providers or products and want to cut back on their spending.
> 4. Process Pain Paints
>    Process pain points are areas where your business is creating friction or pain for buyers due to sub-optimal processes. Customers love convenience so they will switch to another brand if they find the buying process too difficult with your company.
>
> #### Identify Customer Pain Points
>
> 1. Perform Qualitative Market Research (by giving a score from 1 - 10), this is more favored because:

>    - Quantitative Market Research is too restrictive for identifying pain points, 
>      because it gives only a Yes or No questions 
>    - No two customer pain points are the same
>      It is vary between groups; You can easily identify which pain points are common, which aren't which are serious buying blocks, and so on
>    - Ask the right questions
>      You have the opportunity to ask open-ended questions where the customer can go into as much detail as they like. You may also choose to offer an open forum to shed light on their experiences without being directed.
> 2. Talk to your Customer Service and Sales Teams
>    It’s important not to **mix up** between <u>their pain points and the customer’s pain points</u>

> #### Three Levels of Pain Points in Customer Experience. [Source](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pain-points/)
>
> 1. Interaction-Level Pain Point
>    A user is passed from support person to support person
>
>    - Identify using Usability Testing
>    - Prioritize based on issue’s impact on the user and on the popularity of the product, how often the problem occurs, and also if a user is likely to encounter it more than once.
>
> 2. Journey-Level Pain Point
>    A user places an order and does not receive it for months
>
>    - Identify using a combination of exploratory research such as user interviews, diary and field studies and customer-journey mapping
>    - Prioritize the impact of the pain point across the journey and the feasibility of solving pain points
>
>    It needs pervasive organizational restructuring and internal process changes 
>    ([even a CX Transformation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/framework-cx-transformation/))
>
> 3. Relationship-Level Pain Point
>    A user pays for a service but still has to watch ads
>
>    - Identify benchmarking surveys (measuring brand loyalty, likelihood to recommend, and overall customer satisfaction), analytics data, or technical infrastructure that tracks and manages data of individual customers.
>    - Prioritize the impact of the pain point across several journeys, churn rate caused by a pain point, brand loyalty lost as a consequence of the pain point.
>
>    This are the most complex and difficult to prioritize. It requires many business units collaborating to enact long term change - internal and external to the company
>
> > Pain points are diverse; they can be broad or specific, severe or relatively insignificant, and obvious or hidden. Identifying pain points is a first step to creating solutions that address users’ real needs. 
> >
> > Remember, **pain points include usability issues** (those are pain points at the interaction level), but can also include other, higher- level issues in the customer journey or in the overall relationship between customers and organizations.

> ##### Effect of Pain Points on User
>
> 1. Time Cost
> 2. Financial Cost
> 3. Loss of Trust and Confidence
